## [v3.0.0](https://github.com/adiwg/mdKeywords/tree/v3.0.0)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/adiwg/mdKeywords/compare/v2.0.1...v3.0.0)

**Notes:**

Multiple undocumented updates were merged directly into the master branch.

The updates were planned, however, they were not documented through issues, and thus, are not easily described. Application testing demonstrated that the applications using the keywords functioned as expected. A decision was make to retain, and not roll-back, the updates. The mdKeywords version was incremented from v2.0.1 to v3.0.0 to indicate the change in build status and the move away from use of NPM packages to keyword hosting on the jsDelivr content delivery system.

**Changes:**

- Set dev as the default branch
- Add vocabulary configuration file to define default vocabularies
- Add harvester scripts to generate custom vocabularies
- Create GitHub actions workflow to automate keyword harvesting

**Deprecated:**

- USGS and LCC custom vocabularies will be removed from the default vocabulary configuration file. There is currently no timeline for the removal. Removal will be dependant upon full implementation of custom vocabulary features in the [mdProfiles](https://github.com/adiwg/mdProfiles) and [mdEditor](https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor) components. Organizations should begin evaluating use of harvester scripts and identify alternate locations for hosting custom vocabularies.

## [v2.0.1](https://github.com/adiwg/mdKeywords/tree/v2.0.1)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/adiwg/mdKeywords/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1)

**Deprecated:**

- NPM mdKeywords packages will no longer be created. Profiles will now be distributed via jsDelivr (https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/gh/adiwg/mdkeywords). Applications using the previous [NPM mdKeyword package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdkeywords) should migrate to jsDelivr.
