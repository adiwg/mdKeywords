In the stratosphere, between approximately 15 and 50 km above the Earth’s surface, a layer rich in ozone serves as a “sunscreen” for the world by shielding the Earth’s surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation. This absorption of solar energy also affects atmospheric circulation patterns and thus influences weather around the globe. Moreover, throughout the atmosphere, ozone is the key ingredient that initiates chemical cleansing of the atmosphere of various pollutants, such as carbon monoxide and methane, among others, which could otherwise accumulate to harmful levels or exert a stronger influence on climate.

It usually occurs in combination\r\nwith plant sugars. The tuberous edible plant of the spurge family called\r\ncassava (also known as manioc, mandioc, or yuca) was used by primitive peoples\r\nto produce HCN for poison darts and arrows. HCN is produced by other plants,\r\nbacteria and fungi. Emissions from CN radicals are occasionally observed from\r\nlightning disturbed air. Hydrogen cyanide is produced by biomass burning since\r\nnitrogen in plant material is mostly present as amino acids and upon combustion\nthis nitrogen is emitted as a variety of compounds including NH3, NO, NO2, N2O,\norganic nitriles and nitrates. It is interesting to note that the atmospheric\r\nmeasurements of HCN reported by Zander et al. (1988) gave a mixing ratio for\r\nHCN in the Southern Hemisphere which was approximately 5% higher than that for\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere. This may be due to biomass burning.\r\nThere are many anthropogenic sources of compounds containing CN which can be\r\nreleased into the atmosphere. Cyanides are used in a variety of chemical\r\nprocesses including fumigation, case hardening of iron and steel,\r\nelectroplating and in the concentration of ores.

Some catalytic\r\nconverters in bad repair can produce large amounts of Hydrogen cyanide.\r\nHydrogen cyanide is produced in large quantities for laboratory and commercial\r\nuse by three principle methods: Treatment of sodium cyanide with sulphuric\r\nacid, catalytic oxidation of a methane-ammonia mixture, and decomposition of\r\nformamide (HCONH2).",

Nevertheless, unavoidable leakage in the production, distribution, storage and consumption of H2 could drastically alter the mixing ratio of H2 in the atmosphere. Although it is not a greenhouse gas itself, H2 affects the atmospheric lifetime of the greenhouse gas methane and many other species via its reaction with the hydroxyl (OH) radical (Schultz et al.,2003). In addition, H2 is an important source for stratospheric water vapor, which provides the substrate for polar stratospheric clouds that play a key role in the formation of the stratospheric polar ozone hole. Therefore, increasing levels of H2 in the atmosphere will counteract the predicted recovery of the ozone hole (Tromp et al., 2003; Warwick et al.,2004; Feck et al., 2008).",

Even in Europe the prevailing west to northwest winds of summer have been called the 'European monsoon.' The primary cause is the much greater annual variation of temperature over large land areas compared with neighboring ocean surfaces, causing an excess of pressure over the continents in winter and a deficit in summer, but other factors such as the relief features of the land have a considerable effect. The monsoons are strongest on the southern and eastern sides of Asia, the largest landmass, but monsoons also occur on the coasts of tropical regions wherever the planetary circulation is not strong enough to inhibit them. They have been described in Spain, northern Australia, Africa except the Mediterranean, Texas, and the western coasts of the United States and Chile.

Particle pollution is made up of a number of components, including acids (such as nitrates and sulfates), organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles.\n\nThe size of particles is directly linked to their potential for causing health problems. EPA is concerned about particles that are 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller because those are the particles that generally pass through the throat and nose and enter the lungs. Once inhaled, these particles can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health effects. EPA groups particle pollution into two categories: \n<BR>\n- 'Inhalable coarse particles,' such as those found near roadways and dusty industries, are larger than 2.5 micrometers and smaller than 10 micrometers in diameter.\n<BR>\n- 'Fine particles,' such as those found in smoke and haze, are 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller. These particles can be directly emitted from sources such as forest fires, or they can form when gases emitted from power plants, industries and automobiles react in the air.",

                    "definition": "Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) is an important component of the global nitrogen cycle [Galloway and Cowling, 2002; Galloway et al., 2008; Sutton et al., 2007, 2008; Erisman et al., 2008, 2013; Fowler et al., 2013, 2015]. In the troposphere ammonia reacts rapidly with acids such as sulfuric (H2SO4), nitric (HNO3) to form fine particulate matter (PM2.5) [Malm et al., 2004]. These ammonium (NH4+) containing aerosols affect Earth's radiative balance, both directly by scattering incoming radiation [Adams et al., 2001; Martin et al., 2004; Henze et al., 2012] and indirectly as cloud condensation nuclei [Abbatt et al., 2006]. PM2.5 endangers public health by penetrating the human respiratory systems, depositing in the lungs and alveolar regions [Pope et al., 2002], and causing premature mortality [Lelieveld et al., 2015]. A precursor of these inorganic aerosols, gaseous NH3 is often the limiting species in their formation [Wang et al., 2013; Lelieveld et al., 2015]. Excess reactive nitrogen reduces biodiversity and causes harmful algal blooms and anoxic conditions. Dry deposition of gaseous ammonia may have substantially greater adverse impacts on ecosystem health than deposition of ammonium in aerosols or precipitation [Sheppard et al., 2011]. In contrast, PM2.5 has greater impact on human morbidity and mortality. In this article we quantify recent (~14 year) increases in tropospheric ammonia and suggest likely causes for these trends.",

It is sufficiently cold for noctilucent ('night shining') clouds to form in summer, at altitudes around 83 km. \n\nNoctilucent clouds can only be seen when the sun is shining on them (at ~83 km) and not on the lower atmosphere, i.e. when the sun is between 6 and 16 degrees below the horizon.\n\nThey are a summer, polar phenomena but because of the restrictive viewing conditions they are most commonly observed at latitudes between 55 and 65 degrees. \n\nNoctilucent clouds were first reported in 1885 when they were independently observed in Germany and Russia. This was two years after the volcanic explosion of Krakatoa in the Straits of Java.\n\nOne hypothesis is that the initial observation of noctilucent clouds was related to an increase in the number of observers of the twilight skies attracted by the spectacular displays resulting from the globally distributed volcanic debris of Krakatoa. Alternatively, water vapour injected into the upper atmosphere by the volcano ultimately reached the cold, dry upper mesophere.\n\nSubsequent observations have proved that noctilucent clouds are not solely related to volcanic activity, and their volcanic association is now scientifically contentious. It has been alternatively claimed that the appearance of noctilucent clouds is the earliest evidence of anthropogenic climate change.\n\nNoctilucent cloud observations from north-west Europe over the last 30 years show an increasing trend in the number of nights on which the clouds are observed each summer season, superimposed on a decadal variability that appears to be solar-cycle related.\n\nCompeting anthropogenic explanations for this increasing occurrence of noctilucent clouds focus on either excessive greenhouse cooling of the middle atmosphere or increased water vapour linked to increased methane release associated principally with intensive farming activities.\n\nThey have been observed thousands of times in the northern hemisphere, but less than 100 observations have been reported from the southern hemisphere. It has not been resolved if this is due to inter-hemispheric differences (temperature &/or water vapour) in the atmosphere at these altitudes, or the lack of observers and poorer observing conditions in southern latitudes.",

PSCs provide surfaces upon which heterogeneous chemical reactions take place. These reactions lead to the production of free radicals of chlorine in the stratosphere which directly destroy ozone molecules.\n\nPSCs form poleward of about 60ºS latitude in the altitude range 10 km to 25 km during the winter and early spring. The clouds are classified into Types I and II according to their particle size and formation temperature.\n\nType II clouds, also known as nacreous or mother-of-pearl clouds, are composed of ice crystals and form when temperatures are below the ice frost point (typically below -83ºC).\n\nThe Type I PSCs are optically much thinner than the Type II clouds, and have a formation threshold temperature 5 to 8ºC above the frost point. These clouds consist mainly of hydrated droplets of nitric acid and sulphuric acid.\n\nDespite two decades of research, the climatology of PSCs is not well described, and this impacts on the accuracy of ozone depletion models. The timing and duration of PSC events, their geographic extent and vertical distributions, and their annual variability are not well understood.The Davis lidar has been used to study stratospheric clouds since 2001. The observations consist of profiles of Rayeligh laser backscatter at a wavelength of 532 nm as a function of altitude. The measurements are being used to investigate the climatology of the clouds and their relation to the temperature structure of the stratosphere, and the influence of atmospheric gravity waves and planetary waves in modulating their structure and ozone depletion.",

Upwelling creates a layer of cool water at the surface, which cools the air immediately above the water. As the moist, marine air cools, water vapor condenses into water droplets, and low clouds form. These lumpy, sheet-like clouds are marine stratocumulus clouds, and they are a common occurrence along the western coasts of the continents, where upwelling is common. Probably no higher than a kilometer (about 3,000 feet) above the Earth’s surface, the clouds in the image hug the coastline in echo of the cool ocean currents beneath them. In contrast, warm, dry air dominates over land, keeping skies cloud free.",

Colliding drops having negligible impact energy compared to their surface energy behave as water spheres that collide with a collision efficiency (the fraction of small drops that collide with a large drop within the geometric collision cross section) predicted by the theory for falling spheres. The result of increasing impact energy is to flatten the colliding drops at the point of impact, impeding the drainage of the air and delaying contact between them. As the distortion relaxes, the drops rebound, reducing the coalescence efficiency for cloud drops and drizzle drops colliding with smaller drops. At larger impact energy, separation will occur if the rotational energy (fixed by conservation of angular momentum) is higher than the surface energy of the coalescing drops. This phenomenon, termed temporary coalescence, can result in satellite droplets considerably smaller than either of the parent drops. This phenomenon is also called partial coalescence because the large drop may gain mass as a result of the higher internal pressure in the small drop. At still larger impact energy, drop breakup occurs for the smaller drop. About 20% of the high-energy collisions between large raindrops (d > 3 mm) and drizzle drops (d > 0.2 mm) result in the disintegration of both drops. Other factors that affect coalescence are electric charge and electric field, both of which promote coalescence, leading to earlier onset of coalescence during an interaction so that coalescence efficiencies are increased by suppression of rebound and temporary coalescence. All of these processes are important in formation of precipitation in all liquid clouds both above and below 0°C.",

Rationale: Numerous researchers are studying hypoxia, the hypoxic\nzone, and its effect on fisheries. It is becoming a highly visible hot\ntopic in the Gulf of Mexico and other regions as the onset of hypoxia is\nlargely due to increased nutrient run off from agriculture practices in the\nMississippi River watershed.

However, compared to mesoscale eddies, they remain poorly studied due to technical difficulties in observing these small-scale and ephemeral ocean features. Satellite altimeters typically cannot characterize eddies smaller than 100–200 km in diameter. In subtropical and tropical oceans sea surface temperature imagery lose their spatial contrast during summer, and satellite ocean color imagery also suffer to lack of sufficient observations due to clouds, strong sun glint, and stray light (Chen et al., 2019; Hu, 2011). As a result, to date, there is generally a lack of synoptic and long-term characterization of submesoscale eddies in the world's oceans, except perhaps in some small regions when continuous land-based high frequency-radar observations are available.",

The mesoscale field is characterized by temperature and salinity anomalies with associated flow anomalies that are nearly in geostrophic balance. Although only the surface expression of mesoscale eddies is visible in satellite images of sea surface height or temperature, they are in fact three dimensional structures that reach down into the pycnocline.

                        "definition": "The sea surface foundation temperature is the water temperature that is not influenced by a thermally stratified layer of diurnal temperature variability (either by daytime warming or nocturnal cooling). The foundation temperature is named to indicate that it is the temperature from which the growth of the diurnal thermocline develops each day, noting that on some occasions with a deep mixed layer there is no clear foundation temperature in the surface layer. In general, sea surface foundation temperature will be similar to a night time minimum or pre-dawn value at depths of between approximately 1 and 5 meters. In the absence of any diurnal signal, the foundation temperature is considered equivalent to the quantity with standard name sea_surface_subskin_temperature. The sea surface foundation temperature defines a level in the upper water column that varies in depth, space, and time depending on the local balance between thermal stratification and turbulent energy and is expected to change slowly over the course of a day. If possible, a data variable with the standard name sea_surface_foundation_temperature should be used with a scalar vertical coordinate variable to specify the depth of the foundation level. Sea surface foundation temperature is measured at the base of the diurnal thermocline or as close to the water surface as possible in the absence of thermal stratification. Only in situ contact thermometry is able to measure the sea surface foundation temperature. Analysis procedures must be used to estimate sea surface foundation temperature value from radiometric satellite measurements of the quantities with standard names sea_surface_skin_temperature and sea_surface_subskin_temperature. Sea surface foundation temperature provides a connection with the historical concept of a 'bulk' sea surface temperature considered representative of the oceanic mixed layer temperature that is typically represented by any sea temperature measurement within the upper ocean over a depth range of 1 to approximately 20 meters. The general term, 'bulk' sea surface temperature, has the standard name sea_surface_temperature with no associated vertical coordinate axis. Sea surface foundation temperature provides a more precise, well defined quantity than 'bulk' sea surface temperature and, consequently, is more representative of the mixed layer temperature. The temperature of sea water at a particular depth (other than the foundation level) should be reported using the standard name sea_water_temperature and, wherever possible, supplying a vertical coordinate axis or scalar coordinate variable.",

These were formed by turbidity currents which covered the\r\npreexisting topography. Most abyssal plains are located between the base of the\ncontinental rise and the abyssal hills. The remainder are trench abyssal plains\nthat lie in the bottom of deep-sea trenches.

Microfossils are a heterogeneous bunch of fossil remains studied as a single discipline because rock samples must be processed in certain ways to remove them and microscopes must be used to study them. Thus, microfossils, unlike other kinds of fossils, are not grouped according to their relationships to one another, but only because of their generally small size and methods of study. For example, fossils of bacteria, foraminifera, diatoms, very small invertebrate shells or skeletons, pollen, and tiny bones and teeth of large vertebrates, among others, can be called microfossils. But it is an unnatural grouping. Nevertheless, this utilitarian subdivision of paleontology, first recognized in 1883, is very significant in geology, paleontology, and biology. \n\nMicrofossils have many applications to petroleum geology (Fleisher and Lane, in press, Ventress, 1991, LeRoy, 1977). The two most common uses are: biostratigraphy and paleoenvironmental analyses. Biostratigraphy is the differentiation of rock units based upon the fossils which they contain. Paleoenvironmental analysis is the interpretation of the depositional environment in which the rock unit formed, based upon the fossils found within the unit. There are many other uses of fossils besides these, including: paleoclimatology, biogeography, and thermal maturation.",

Defined and developed by Davis and Sugiura [1966], AE has been usefully employed both qualitatively and quantitatively as a correlative index in studies of substorm morphology, the behavior of communication satellites, radio propagation, radio scintillation, and the coupling between the interplanetary magnetic field and the earth's magnetosphere.

This is accomplished by applying different types of silvicultural treatments such as thinning, harvesting, planting, pruning, prescribed burning and site preparation. Intermediate treatments (thinning) are designed to enhance growth, quality, vigor, and composition of the stand after establishment or regeneration and prior to final harvest. Regeneration treatments (harvesting) are applied to mature stands in order to establish a new age class of trees. Regeneration methods are grouped into four categories: coppice, even-aged, two-aged, and uneven-aged.\n\nAll vegetation activities, including prescribed fire, wildlife habitat improvement, timber harvesting and cutting trees in campgrounds for human safety must have a silvicultural prescription. A silvicultural prescription is a document which has a planned series of treatments designed to change current stand structure and composition of a stand to one that meets management goals. The prescription normally considers ecological, economic, and societal objectives and constraints. In the Forest Service, silvicultural prescriptions are prepared or reviewed by a certified silviculturist prior to implementing the project or treatment.",

Ecological stoichiometry1,2 provides an integrative approach for such analyses, as all organisms are composed of the same major elements (C, N, P) whose balance affects production, nutrient cycling, and food-web dynamics3,4. Here we show both similarities and differences in the C:N:P ratios of primary producers (autotrophs) and invertebrate primary consumers (herbivores) across habitats. Terrestrial food webs are built on an extremely nutrient-poor autotroph base with C:P and C:N ratios higher than in lake particulate matter, although the N:P ratios are nearly identical. Terrestrial herbivores (insects) and their freshwater counterparts (zooplankton) are nutrient-rich and indistinguishable in C:N:P stoichiometry. In both lakes and terrestrial systems, herbivores should have low growth efficiencies (10–30%) when consuming autotrophs with typical carbon-to-nutrient ratios. These stoichiometric constraints on herbivore growth appear to be qualitatively similar and widespread in both environments.",

Studies conducted mainly in vertebrates have demonstrated that LC-PUFA can be biosynthesized through the concerted action of two sets of enzymes, namely fatty acyl desaturases (Fads) and elongation of very long-chain fatty acid (Elovl) proteins. While LC-PUFA research is a thriving field, mainly focused on human health, an integrated view regarding the evolution of LC-PUFA biosynthetic genetic machinery in chordates is yet to be produced. Particularly important is to understand whether lineage specific life history trajectories, as well as major biological transitions, or particular genomic processes such as genome duplications have impacted the evolution of LC-PUFA biosynthetic pathways. Here we review the gene repertoire of Fads and Elovl in chordate genomes and the diversity of substrate specificities acquired during evolution. We take advantage of the magnitude of genomic and functional data to show that combination duplication processes and functional plasticity have generated a wide diversity of physiological capacities in extant lineages. A clear evolutionary framework is provided, which will be instrumental for the full clarification of functional capacities between the various vertebrate groups",

There are several taxa for which suitable, phylogenetically-controlled analyses have been conducted. This means that the effects of phylogeny, which may be considerable, have been removed. Removing the effects of phylogeny allow one to test whether an adaptation has occurred. For example, a character may be considered a desert adaptation because many desert-dwelling species possess the character, and non-desert-dwelling species do not. However, if there are many desert-dwelling species in a particular part of a clade, then this character may have evolved by chance alone. Select examples from tenebrionid beetles, lizards, birds, and mammals are considered.",

Furthermore, Fe deposition reconstructions derived from the palaeoproxies particulate dust and calcium differ significantly from the Fe flux data available. The ability to measure high temporal resolution Fe data in polar ice-cores is crucial for the study of the timing and magnitude of relationships between geochemical events and biological responses in the open ocean. This work adapts an existing flow injection analysis (FIA) methodology for low-level trace Fe determinations with an existing glaciochemical analysis system, continuous flow analysis (CFA) of ice-cores. Fe-induced oxidation of N,N'-dimethyl-p-pheylenediamine (DPD) is used to quantify the biologically more important and easily leachable Fe fraction released in a controlled digestion step at pH ~1.0.

Climate forcings investigated include changes in insolation of the order of the major orbital cycles that control the long-term behavior of atmospheric circulation patterns through changes in ice volume (sea level), events such as the Heinrich events (massive discharges of icebergs first identified in t he marine record) that are found to operate on a 6100-year cycle due largely to the lagged response of ice sheets to changes in insolation and consequent glacier dynamics, and rapid climate change events (massive reorganizations of atmospheric circulation) that are demonstrated to operate on 1450-year cycles. Changes in insolation and associated positive feedbacks related to ice sheets may assist in explaining favorable time periods and controls on the amplitude of massive rapid climate change events. Explanation for the exact timing and global synchroneity of these events is, however, more complicated. Preliminary evidence points to possible solar variability-climate associations for these events and perhaps others that are embedded in our ice-core-derived atmospheric circulation records.",

The EA pattern is structurally similar to the NAO, and consists of a north-south dipole of anomaly centers spanning the North Atlantic from east to west. The anomaly centers of the EA pattern are displaced southeastward to the approximate nodal lines of the NAO pattern. For this reason, the EA pattern is often interpreted as a “southward shifted” NAO pattern. However, the lower-latitude center contains a strong subtropical link in association with modulations in the subtropical ridge intensity and location. This subtropical link makes the EA pattern distinct from its NAO counterpart. This EA pattern is similar to that shown in the Barnston and Livezey (1987) study, but is distinctly different from the EA pattern originally defined by Wallace and Gutzler (1981).\n\nThe positive phase of the EA pattern is associated with above-average surface temperatures in Europe in all months, and with below-average temperatures over the southern U.S. during January-May and in the north-central U.S. during July-October. It is also associated with above-average precipitation over northern Europe and Scandinavia, and with below-average precipitation across southern Europe.\n\nThe EA pattern exhibits very strong multi-decadal variability in the 1950-2004 record, with the negative phase prevailing during much of 1950-1976, and the positive phase occurring during much of 1977-2004.

Therefore, strong positive or negative phases of this pattern reflect pronounced zonal and meridional variations in the location and intensity of the entrance region of the Pacific (or East Asian) jet steam. \n\nIn the summer and fall, the WP pattern becomes increasingly wave-like, and a third prominent center appears over Alaska and the Beaufort Sea, with a sign opposite to the center over the western North Pacific. This wave structure is most evident in the Fall, when it extends downstream along a quasi great-circle route into the western United States. The time series of the WP pattern indicates considerable intermonthly and interannual variability, and persistence of a particular phase of the pattern is relatively common.",

These regions capture the largest precipitation anomalies associated with the interannual variations of the Walker circulation and contain the largest correlations between GPCP and Nino 3.4 and SOI. Within P and MC the absolute magnitude of the largest correlation is over +0.6. \n\nBecause of the spatially varying nature of rainfall, it was decided to use a moving block average which would capture the strongest zonal gradients within the equatorial Pacific. This procedure is unlike many fixed area average indices, and allows for a realistic meridional component of the precipitation gradient and migration of the ascending and descending branches of the Walker circulation.",

Technically, the SPI is the\r\nnumber of standard deviations that the observed value would deviate\r\nfrom the long-term mean, for a normally distributed random\r\nvariable. Since precipitation is not normally distributed, a\r\ntransformation is first applied so that the transformed precipitation\r\nvalues follow a normal distribution.\r\nThe Standardized Precipitation Index was designed to explicitly\r\nexpress the fact that it is possible to simultaneously experience wet\r\nconditions on one or more time scales, and dry conditions at other\r\ntime scales, often a difficult concept to convey in simple terms to\r\ndecision-makers. Consequently, a separate SPI value is calculated for\r\na selection of time scales, covering the last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\r\n9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, and 72 months, and ending\r\non the last day of the latest month.",

The index was developed through consultation and collaboration with countries, institutions and experts across the globe. This index is designed to be used with economic and social vulnerability indices to provide insights into the processes that can negatively influence the sustainable development of countries.\n\nThe reason for using indices for this purpose is to provide a rapid and standardised method for characterising vulnerability in an overall sense, and identifying issues that may need to be addressed within each of the three pillars of sustainability, namely environmental, economic and social aspects of a country’s development. Development is often achieved through trade-offs between these pillars. Therefore, in order to promote sustainability, it has become increasingly important to be able to measure how vulnerable each aspect is to damage and to identify ways of building resilience. With this information to hand, the outcome for countries could be optimised for their unique situations and development goals.",

The Crop Moisture Index (CMI) is also a formula that was developed by Wayne Palmer subsequent to his development of the Palmer Drought Index. The CMI responds more rapidly than the Palmer Index and can change considerably from week to week, so it is more effective in calculating\nshort-term abnormal dryness or wetness affecting agriculture. CMI is designed to indicate normal conditions at the beginning and end of the growing season; it uses the same levels as the Palmer Drought Index.

Greenland, due to having a large and relatively stable deep ice sheet is often the target for drilling ice cores.\n\nIsotopic analysis of the ice in the core can be linked to temperature and global sea level variations. Analysis of the air contained in bubbles in the ice can reveal the palaeocomposition of the atmosphere, in particular CO2 variations. Volcanic eruptions leave identifiable ash layers.\n\nWhile it sounds simple to analyze, there are issues of ice compression, flow, and other factors that must be taken into consideration when doing reconstructions from such data. I attended a talk at ICCC 09 that showed one of the ice core operations had procedures that left significant contamination issues for CO2.

The amount of growth is an indicator of how much ground water dripped into the cave. Little growth might indicate a drought, just as rapid growth could point to heavy precipitation. When the speleothems stop growing, the outside becomes dirty and eroded in places, giving it a dull appearance. Spelothems can be dated by measuring how much uranium has decayed. Evidence of past climate changes can be inferred from measuring oxygen isotopes in speleothems.",

When the ice-caps melt during periods of warm climate the proportion of 18O decreases. There are two ways of obtaining data about the 16O to 18O ratio, both using measurements made using a mass spectrometer. The first is to use cores from the polar ice-caps which preserve layers of snow ultimately made from sea water. The second is to use the skeletons of foraminifera preserved in ocean-bottom ooze because these marine fossils had the same 16O to 18O ratio as the sea water during the time they were alive. Using this data a series of at least eleven cycles of cooling and warming climatic conditions have been recognized in the northern hemisphere during the Pleistocene.",

Permafrost and clathrates degrade on warming, thus large releases of methane from these sources may arise as a result of global warming.[3][4] Other sources of methane include submarine taliks, river transport, ice complex retreat, submarine permafrost and decaying gas hydrate deposits.[5]",

The uncertainty of each set of observations is harnessed to define the limits of acceptability (LOA), a set of criteria used to objectively evaluate the acceptability of different GHM structures and parameterisations. This framework is used to compare and diagnose deficiencies in three melt and three run-off-routing model structures. Increased model complexity is shown to improve acceptability when evaluated against specific signatures but does not always result in better consistency across all signatures, emphasising the difficulty in appropriate model selection and the need for multi-model prediction approaches to account for model selection uncertainty. Melt and run-off-routing structures demonstrate a hierarchy of influence on river discharge signatures with melt model structure having the most influence on discharge hydrograph seasonality and run-off-routing structure on shorter-timescale discharge events. None of the tested GHM structural configurations returned acceptable simulations across the full population of signatures. The framework outlined here provides a comprehensive and rigorous assessment tool for evaluating the acceptability of different GHM process hypotheses. Future melt and run-off model forecasts should seek to diagnose structural model deficiencies and evaluate diagnostic signatures of system behaviour using a LOA framework.",

                "definition": "Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.",
