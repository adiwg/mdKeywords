The drill cuttings are removed by injection of compressed air into the hole via the annular area between the innertube and the drill rod. The cuttings are then blown back to surface up the inner tube where they pass through the sample separating system and are collected if needed. Drilling continues with the addition of rods to the top of the drill string. Air core drilling can occasionally produce small chunks of cored rock."

Solid flight augers/bucket augers are used in harder ground construction drilling. In some cases, mine shafts are dug with auger drills. Small augers can be mounted on the back of a utility truck, with large augers used for sinking piles for bridge foundations."

The impact of the drill bit fractures the rock and in many shale rock situations increases the water flow into a well over rotary. Many large diameter water supply wells, especially deep wells completed in bedrock aquifers, were completed using this drilling method."

Matrix hardness, diamond size and dosing can be varied according to the rock which must be cut. Holes within the bit allow water to be delivered to the cutting face. This provides three essential functions: lubrication, cooling, and removal of drill cuttings from the hole. Core samples are retrieved via the use of a core tube, a hollow tube placed inside the rod string and pumped with water until it locks into the core barrel. As the core is drilled, the core barrel slides over the core as it is cut. An \"overshot\" attached to the end of the winch cable is lowered inside the rod string and locks on to the backend (aka head assembly), located on the top end of the core barrel. The winch is retracted, pulling the core tube to the surface. The core does not drop out of the inside of the core tube when lifted because either a split ring core lifter or basket retainer allow the core to move into, but not back out of the tube."

Algal flats survive only when an area is salty enough to eliminate snails and other herbivorous animals that eat algae, yet is not so salty that the algae cannot survive. The most common species of algae found on algal flats are blue-green algae of the genera Scytonema and Schizothrix. These algae can tolerate the daily extremes in temperature and oxygen that typify conditions on the flats. Other plants sometimes found on algal flats include one-celled green algae, flagellates, diatoms, bacteria, and isolated scrubby red and black mangroves, as well as patches of saltwort. Animals include false cerith, cerion snails, fiddler crabs, and great land crabs. Flats with well developed algal mats are restricted for the most part to the Keys, with Sugarloaf and Crane Keys offering prime examples of algal flat habitat. (Audubon, 1991)"

Includes processes that are normal in the surficial or outer part of the earth’s crust [Jackson, 1997]. Changes in a deeply buried sedimentary rock may be continuous from diagenesis into recrystallization to form a metamorphic rock. Robertson [1999] defines the boundary between diagenesis and metamorphism in sedimentary rocks as follows: \\the boundary between diagenesis and metamorphism is somewhat arbitrary and strongly dependent on the rock types involved. For example changes take place in organic materials at lower temperatures than in rocks dominated by silicate minerals. In mudrocks, a white mica (illite) crystallinity value of less than 0.42D.2U obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis, is used to define the onset of metamorphism (Kisch, 1991). In this scheme, the first appearance of glaucophane, lawsonite, paragonite, prehnite, pumpellyite or stilpnomelane is taken to indicate the lower limit of metamorphism (Frey and Kisch, 1987, Bucher and Frey, 1994, Frey and Robinson, 1998). Most workers agree that such mineral growth starts at 150 ± 50° C in silicate rocks. Many rock types may show no change in mineralogy under these conditions and hence the recognition of the onset of metamorphism will vary with bulk composition.\\"

Thus, the need to use other hydrophobic materials (e.g. coal) to either form agglomerates together with gold or act as a carrier of gold particles. Agglomerates are prepared in a previous step and then added to the ore pulp in a second step. The gold particles, being oilfilic, penetrate into the agglomerates. In a continuous operation the agglomerates would be maintained in contacting tanks until they reach a pre-determined gold content. The tailings are discarded by means of a screen situated at the upper part of the tanks. The recovery of gold from agglomerates is obtained in a later step by burning the agglomerates and then separating the gold from the ashes."

Carbonate ores are also smelted with charcoal, but are sometimes need to be calcined first. Other materials may need to be added as flux, aiding the melting of the oxide ores and assisting in the formation of a slag, as the flux reacts with impurities, such as silicon compounds. Smelting usually takes place at a temperature above the melting point of the metal, but processes vary considerably according to the ore involved and other matters."

Pyroxene (augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite) and calcium-rich plagioclase are common phenocryst minerals. Olivine may also be a phenocryst, and when present, may have rims of pigeonite. Only in tholeiitic basalt is olivine in reaction relationship with melt. Interstitial siliceous residue may be present, and is often glassy. Tholeiitic basalt is relatively poor in sodium. This category includes most basalts of the ocean floor, most large oceanic islands, and continental flood basalts such as the Columbia River Plateau."

As a general rule, terms should be treated as near-synonyms only in subject areas that are peripheral to the domain of the controlled vocabulary. When concepts can be distinguished in the controlled vocabulary domain with sufficient precision to justify their representation as separate terms, they should be individually defined and retained. If two concepts cannot be consistently and reliably differentiated from each otherhowever, a term for one concept should be selected as the preferred term and a USE reference made from the other."
