While individual reef systems likely host tens of thousands of species, most of this diversity remains undocumented.  Significant declines in key indicators of reef ecosystem health suggest a degradation of coral reefs globally in response to the combined effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors. The vulnerability of coral reef ecosystems is anticipated to increase significantly in response to climate change induced coral bleaching and disease, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and changing storm tracks. There is a clear danger that much reef biodiversity could be lost before it is even documented, and researchers will be left with a limited and poor understanding of undisturbed reef communities on which to base future management decisions.  Under these rapidly changing conditions, a key goal for reef resource managers and policy makers over the next several decades will be the development of tools to increase the resilience of global communities through effective conservation of coral reef biodiversity.  In order to develop reasonable approaches to improve the resilience of coral reef biodiversity, and to effectively use the ecosystem approach to management, it is first necessary to understand existing biodiversity and changes over time. \n\nSummary provided by http://www.creefs.org/",

Resulting impacts on terrestrial/freshwater ecosystems affect a) higher trophic levels and resources for Arctic residents, b) biodiversity in both polar regions and beyond due to the migration of many species, and c) land-atmosphere processes through changes in surface reflectivity and exchange of trace gases. \nPolar lands are vast and diverse and the knowledge of geographical variation in recent ecosystem change is limited. Attribution of change is difficult because the primary drivers vary from site to site and between the poles: at some sites multiple drivers of change (e.g. climate, UV-B, contaminants, habitat fragmentation) operate concurrently. \nBetween 1964 and 1974, a network of IBP* Tundra Biome sites was established in both polar areas. Intensive investigations of primary production, production processes, decomposition, plant community structure and soil fauna were carried out together with studies of freshwater ecosystems. These sites and many of the original researchers represent a unique asset for detecting multidecadal environmental change. IPY provides timely opportunities for collating data on past changes, passing knowledge to new generations of researchers and documenting environmental characteristics of sites to facilitate detection and attribution of future changes at IBP sites and others, and on IBP topics in an interdisciplinary context. \n\nGoals\n1. To assess multidecadal past changes in the structure and function of Polar terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and environments in relation to diverse divers of change \n2. To assess the current status of Polar ecosystems and their biodiversity\n3. To permanently record precise locations of old sites in order to perpetuate platforms for a) the assessment of future changes in Polar ecosystems and their environments and b) sampling for Polar research and assessment programmes.\n\nApproach\nIBP sites in both polar regions will be re-visited, documented, and pinpointed with GPS. IBP Tundra Biome alpine and temperate upland sites will be included: comparison among such diverse, cold sites gave increased information on the environmental controls of ecosystem processes. The cold, temperate sites are now even more relevant as they represent analogues of future, warmer, polar sites. BTF will also include appropriate non-IBP polar and sub-polar sites. Investigations of primary production, production processes, decomposition, plant community structure and soil fauna will be repeated using original techniques. Additional measurements (biological and non-biological) will be made following meetings of the BTF group and representatives of linked projects (e.g. ITEX*, IPA*, TARANTELLA*) to maximise the efficiency of time in the field in often remote localities and to ensure cross-disciplinary connections. \nBTF will include, or link to, remote sensing projects that will provide a larger geographical context (GOA*) and provide baseline information on vegetation structure from radar and laser remote sensing. The sites will provide validation for remote sensing and modelling communities. The network will also include other aspects of retrospective analysis of ecosystems (e.g. photographic records from the late 1960&#039;s) and populations (e.g. retrospective growth analyses) and provide sampling possibilities for various environmental assessments. The project will be implemented by younger researchers interacting with older generations. Data and metadata will be registered with the IPY Project COMAAR.",

BLAST I in 1994 in the Eastern\nPacific Ocean, BLAST II, also in 1994 in the Atlantic Ocean, and BLAST\nIII in 1996 in the Southern Oceans near Antarctica.\nThe BLAST I 1994 expedition was intended to test the reliabilty of a\ngas chromatograph / mass spectrometer (GC/MS) combination instrument\nat sea and then measure methyl bromide (CH3Br) in the marine air and\nthe surface waters of the East Pacific Ocean to determine whether the\nocean is a source or a sink for this compound. Along with methyl\nbromide, about 20 other compounds in both air and surface waters was\nmeasured.  The BLAST I expedition started in Seattle, WA, crossed\nseveral regions of the East Pacific and reached the inland passage of\nChile at 41 degrees S, and finally Punta Arenas, Chile, at 54 degrees\nS about 4.5 weeks after its beginning. The NOAA Ship Discoverer (R\n102) was used in the BLAST I expedition.\nThe BLAST II 1994 cruise was a continuation of the BLAST I 94 mission\nin order to verify findings from the first cruise, but in the Atlantic\nOcean rather than the Pacific. In addition to all compounds that were\nmeasured during BLAST 94, other halogenated methanes were also\nmeasured.  The cruise covered an equally wide latitudinal range as\nBLAST 94, similar oceanic regimes such as coastal and coastally\ninfluenced waters, upwelling regions and open ocean gyres, but\nslightly different seasons, fall in the northern hemisphere and spring\nin the southern hemisphere.  The entire cruise was almost 5 weeks long\nand was conducted between 18 October, 1994 and 21 November, 1994. The\ndata for methyl bromide basically confirmed what was seen during BLAST\nI 94 and contributed valuable information to NOAA/CMDL's database for\nmethyl halides. The ship FS Polarstern, used for the BLAST II\nexpedition, operates out of Bremerhaven, Germany, and is run by the\nAlfred Wegener Polarforschung mainly as a research vessel and supply\nship for the German Antarctica station Georg von Neumayer.\nThe BLAST III cruise was conducted between February 22nd and April\n7th, 1996 from McMurdo, Antarctica, along the coast and through the\nice of Antarctica to Punta Arenas, Chile. This cruise was a\ncontinuation of previous BLAST cruises. The main focus on these\nexpeditions has been the measurement of methyl bromide and a suite of\nother methyl halides, very similar to the setup during BLAST II.  The\nship Nathanial Palmer, used for the BLAST III expedition, is operated\nby Antarctic Support Associates which headquarters located in\nEnglewood, Colorado.\nReferences:\nNet Sink for Atmospheric CH3Br in the East Pacific Ocean, J.M.

            "definition": "The food-borne parasites Trichinella nativa, Toxoplasma gondii, and Anisakis simplex are significant Arctic human zoonoses; endemic to some regions and directly related to the consumption of country foods. Many Northerners remain reliant on wildlife as a source of food, financial income and cultural identity and are demanding programs which will provide greater security in the safety of country foods and programs that ensure the long-term sustainability of wildlife populations. Changing climatic conditions are predicted to alter wildlife habitat, facilitate the northward migration of wildlife diseases and parasites, and alter contaminant cycling and fate; all of which have the potential to detrimentally affect the health and long term sustainability of wildlife populations and ultimately the source and safety of country foods (ACIA 2004; Boonstra 2004; Derocher et al. 2003; Harvell et al., 2002; Hoberg et al., 2002; Kutz et al. 2004; Lie et al. 2004 & 2005). Adequate baseline data (benchmarks) regarding the current health conditions of wildlife (including zoonotic pathogens) is therefore urgently needed for the assessment and prediction of wildlife health impacts resulting from the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors associated with climate change and exposure to anthropogenic contaminants.\n\nIssues regarding potential impacts to Arctic wildlife health and the safety of country foods are complex and will require an integrated approach from a wide range of scientific and social disciplines. The work outlined in this proposal will integrate well in a supportive manner with other IPY proposals (710, 742, 364, 261- Canadian #, and 231) focussed on wildlife health and social aspects.\n\nDuring 2007 to 2009 we propose the following:\nOverall objectives –\n1. Document distribution and abundance of Trichinella nativa, Toxoplasma gondii, and Anisakis simplex in Arctic/subarctic wildlife.\n2. Develop community capacity for ongoing detection and monitoring of above zoonotic pathogens through the development of a community-based testing program in order to provide Northerners rapid information regarding the safety of harvested country foods. This program will build upon other currently existing initiatives such as the Nunavik and Nunavut Trichinellosis Prevention Programs with the purpose enhancing the science, and broadening the present scope of services and capacity building within the communities. Once this framework is established it will be expanded to monitoring a variety of biological ‘indicators’ in various wildlife species in order to begin the process of establishing baseline benchmarks regarding wildlife health by engaging local hunters from selected communities to report on general health indices (i.e., body condition, behavior, pathogen observations). The collection of wildlife health indices will be modeled after the Nunavut Wildlife Health Assessment project and the Shatu Community based monitoring program which have been administered by investigators of this current proposal.\n3. Facilitate the collection of wildlife samples for other researchers outside of this project. It is recognized that the collective impact of multiple IPY research request to northern communities will present a daunting task to local Hunter and Trapper Organizations / Associations within Canada, and similar organizations in other circumpolar locations. We propose to help avoid duplication of sampling effort by working in a liaison manner with the local hunter organization and northern communities for which we have already established a measure of familiarity and trust.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=186",

It will focus on two overall issues: 1) water and energy fluxes and reservoirs over land areas, and 2) monsoonal circulations. CEOP will involve the simultaneous or near-simultaneous collection of observations from several regions around the world. In particular, it will include: 1) several reference sites in the continental-scale experimental regions of GEWEX as well as other regions, 2) extensive field measurements for addressing monsoonal systems, and 3) validation studies for new satellite systems CEOP will lead to: 1) better understanding of water and energy fluxes and reservoirs over specific land areas, 2) progress at better appreciating the role of land areas in the whole climate system, 3) a testing of our capabilities to transfer techniques and models between different GEWEX continental-scale experimental (and other) regions and to predict water-related parameters and, 4) enhanced understanding of the land-atmosphere-ocean interactions.

It will serve to enhance the operations of the Working Groups, Permanent Participants (Indigenous Peoples Organizations), and Observer countries and organizations. It will provide a means for the Working Groups and their Secretariats to establish better communication and cooperation on those elements of day-to-day operations that they share in common, such as a common calendar, joint project directory, and on-line document library, none of which currently exist. The Arctic Portal will also allow for the Arctic Council to hold virtual meetings. This will enable better meeting attendance by the Indigenous Peoples Organizations and other interested stakeholders who have limited financial and staff resources. \nProfessional/Scientific: \nThe Arctic Portal may serve as a main storage of data and provide interactive working venues on the web for research projects in the Arctic, including those of the Arctic Council Working Groups, providing data management and analysis capabilities. Two such projects, submitted as IPY projects are the CBMP and COMAAR. Remote sensing data, and GIS-mapping will now be possible as well through the Arctic Portal, and it will link data from the different Working Groups and scientific projects in the Arctic more easily and cost-effectively. Professionals located across the globe will have better access to data and information sharing through this Portal, including the use of virtual meetings and access to password-protected draft documents. This is especially relevant with Working Group Assessments which involve experts from many different regions, not just the Arctic.\nIndigenous Peoples Organizations/Communities:\nThe Arctic Portal will serve the Indigenous Peoples Organizations of the Arctic Council as well as other Arctic Indigenous communities. It will provide a gateway into a multi-media/multi-lingual site where culture, history and language can be shared and preserved. Stories, maps and photographs of sacred sites, customs, and historical facts can be shared using audio, video, and photography. In addition, this is where important issues of concern can be presented, such as climate change and the changes in migration patterns of species on which livelihoods depend. It will be a tool to help with regional development issues and will communicate many different levels of information, for primary and secondary education up to national and regional governments and policymakers. Intellectual property rights will be correctly addressed with all such information put on the Arctic Portal. \nGeneral Public:\nThe Arctic Portal will make it much easier to download and order Arctic publications using the online document library. It will also provide basic information about the Arctic and its residents, species of flora and fauna, the state of the environment and the current issues being addressed by researchers and policy makers in a simple format for use by educators and the general public. Different maps of the Arctic countries can be made easily available, as well as publications for the public by national agencies of each of the Arctic countries. A general calendar of events will be created to serv the interest of the general public, professionals and other interested stakeholders.",

In addition they are an important food source for smaller vertebrates, like birds. Therefore they act as important key nodes in the arctic food web. The proposed project aims at an extensive documentation of the current status of arctic spider biodiversity and genetic diversity and at the evaluation of climate change-driven modification of spider lifecycles.\n\nArctic spider biodiversity has been addressed selectively, but not yet comprehensively. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that the assessment of spider diversity allows to conclude on the diversity of all arthropods in a given habitat. In addition, spiders, especially lycosids (wolf spiders), are valid model organisms for the monitoring of climate change impact on arctic habitats and their microclimate. In fact, spiders adapt their lifecycle frequencies to microclimatic conditions. Since in the arctic lifecycles take up to several years, changes will almost instantly be assessable by analysis of the life stages present. \n\nOur aim is to combine an arctic-wide spider biodiversity survey and the monitoring of climate induced lifecycle changes in a set of model species at several circum-arctic locations. For the first aim, surveys will be conducted at a selected set of locations, to assess data across the arctic, partly linked to existing stations and other IPY reference sites and projects. In addition, we try to extend our resolution by including students of the whole arctic via the GLOBE project. Collected specimens will be identified by spider taxonomy experts, and characterized using molecular markers for a subset of samples, to address genetic diversity. \n\nOn the long-term, dynamics of species and genetic biodiversity, shall be addressed. This will allow to estimate speed of speciation in the arctic and the time of isolation between distant populations. We will extend existing field methodologies, e.g. pitfall trapping, by establishing complementary new ones, which allow direct monitoring of microclimate changes in arctic habitats. \n\nMajor methodologies will be: (1) pitfall trap and hand collection, classic taxonomy, voucher specimen deposition in museum collections, assembly of a biodiversity database. (2) Microclimate measurements and correlation to biodiversity data. (3) morphometric and statistic lifecycle analysis based on pitfall trap data for selected species of the lycosids. (4) Long term RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) based remote sensing of microchip tagged spiders (lycosids) in semi-closed experimental plots, in order to address activity data, which will be correlated as a baseline to pitfall trap data and allow to record minor activities during winter and cold periods. (5) Manipulated test plots (artificial heating, etc.), in order to simulate microclimate induced lifecycle changes in lycosids directly. (6) Genetic analysis of distant populations, latitudinal and longitudinal. \n\nFor most activities, instant setup at several circum-arctic locations is possible. The RFID-technique will have to be tested first at one location. At a later phase, a standardized setup can be implemented into a variety of circum-arctic locations. All data will be linked to microclimate data as well as general climate data and will be made available to the general public via databases and scientific publications.",

Understandably, one of their main priorities over the past decade has been to improve their social and economic well-being and increase their political voice. However, in light of the ominous predictions about the impacts of global warming on the Arctic ecosystem and the recent rash of catastrophic natural events in both hemispheres, there is growing recognition that significant attention also needs to be paid to protecting the natural environment, which is the third component of sustainable development. For this, much of the burden will fall to the youth who make up well over 50% of the Arctic's indigenous populations and are acknowledged as one of the world's fastest growing demographic groups. \n\nAs they move into adulthood, these young people will soon be faced with the challenge of achieving sustainable livelihoods while protecting their natural environment and conserving its ecological resources and integrity. This will mean making hard choices between oft-competing land and resource uses while maintaining a healthy and reasonable balance between economic, environmental, cultural and social goals. Their task will be further compounded by differing social perceptions and by economic, political and environmental decisions made in multinational and global fora. To help them better face these challenges, it is prudent to begin equipping them with the proper knowledge and skills they will need to make informed decisions on their environment and on sustainable resource use, to acquaint them with global and regional environmental instruments and issues and to engage them early in the ongoing processes, dialogue and debates. This Circumpolar Indigenous Youth Conservation Project consists of three inter-related components designed to achieve these goals. \n\nThe three components of the Circumpolar Indigenous Youth Conservation Project are:\n\n- A series of Circumpolar Indigenous Youth Conservation Workshops to a) better familiarise indigenous youth from the north with contemporary conservation and sustainable use issues and instruments, b) provide them with an opportunity to exchange ideas on the environment and on conservation, and c) seek their input on priorities and future directions for this pilot Circumpolar Conservation Project. A preliminary design for Workshop I has been completed. The executing agency for this component will be the Toronto Zoo.\n\n- An updateable two-part Circumpolar Indigenous Youth Conservation Guide to a) educate and inform young indigenous people on the various global and regional conservation instruments, programmes and organisations relevant to the north, and b) provide an overview of important conservation issues and challenges of particular relevance for northern indigenous peoples. A preliminary design for the two parts of the Guide has been prepared. The executing agency for this component will be Twin Dolphins.\n\n- A pilot Circumpolar Indigenous Youth Conservation Network, initially set up on a trial basis, to a) provide a participatory mechanism for northern indigenous youth to become more involved and engaged in conservation issues and debates, b) integrate them into the processes of conservation and c) to provide them with an ongoing opportunity for dialogue and input. This component is being addressed from both a technical and a content standpoint. It will be carried out in three phases beginning with a Technical Experts Meeting, followed by a Feasibility Study and by a Trial Implementation and Evaluation phase to be carried out in co-operation with several northern schools across the Arctic. A preliminary description of the phases of Component III has been prepared and investigations are now underway to select the appropriate agencies and schools to execute the Network component.\n\nNote: The project proponents are currently investigating the potential of adding a fourth component as a corollary to this Project. This would be a circumpolar network of ex-situ conservation facilities to include, inter alia, the Toronto Zoo and zoos from other countries with expertise in Arctic conservation. These facilities would supplement, complement and enhance the education and outreach components of the Circumpolar Indigenous Youth Conservation Project. The project proponents are currently investigating adding this as a corollary component. \n\nThis Project is consistent with and responds to the overall objectives of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) Implementation Plan; the Millennium Development Goals and Strategy; the UN Decade of Education; and is consistent with the goals and objectives of major Regional and Global Conservation Instruments and Programmes",

First, a passive scalar was released at a constant flux from all constituent surfaces under fully-developed turbulent flows, and then a dataset of relative value of local transfer coefficients of each constituent surface was constructed for a wide range of simple building arrays. Second, simulations with a constant heat flux to one of the constituent surfaces (four vertical walls, roof, and floor, respectively) were performed. The results revealed that the heating of windward-wall generates significantly larger Reynolds stress than the heating of the other surfaces even though the heat fluxes per unit lot area are all the same.\n\nThis summary is from http://ams.confex.com/ams/Annual2006/techprogram/paper_104296.htm",

High rates of morbidity and mortality, increased migration, unemployment and crisis of the native economies are taking place in many Arctic countries along with aggravated environmental problems  contamination and degradation of the natural environment, rapid climate change, and shrinking of the pristine and traditional land use areas. Interdependence of social, economic and environmental problems, with their particular manifestations in the regions of traditional subsistence by indigenous peoples, require development of specific methods of scientific inquiry, aimed at understanding the various national and local approaches to their solutions. Northern populations, depending upon how they are recognized within a wide variety of legal and political frameworks, thereby obtain access to land-based resources. The immemorial presence of people on the land has often provided the justification for their confirmed rights or stipulated privileges (an important distinction) with regard to land use. Once states have defined who can access land resources and what kinds of usage such access might entail, however, a circular dynamic is formed whereby categories of people (and even historically well-defined groups) aspire to be 'recognized' according to these legal criteria. The concept of  'indigenous people' has come to mean different things in different countries and to be associated with a wide variety of accompanying land use regulations. Even the size of a defined ethnic group can be of significance with respect to resource use, as in Russia where placement of peoples on the list of the 'small peoples of the North' holds great significance for their land rights and development, but might also thereby come to disqualify them from membership in a larger group with certain rights of political autonomy. In effect, there are compelling reasons for how groups manage to present themselves and different strategies that must be employed according to the different criteria established by their encompassing states. Similarly, the distinction between group and category is also open to strategic negotiation. In the West, new Indian tribes have been 'constructed' in order to form effective lobbies for environmental protection. This ongoing circular dynamic whereby historical land use has come to define people, and the definition of people has come to define their land use rights, is of essential significance to the sustainability of the human dimension in the North.\nThe proposed research methodology will be based on anthropological fieldwork accompanied by semi-structured sociological interviews of both members of local northern populations, members of their representative organizations and also government resource administrators. We shall seek to establish the current 'rules of the game' with respect to definitions, eligibility criteria, and accompanying land rights/privileges. We will also seek to uncover the tensions between and within groups (haves and have nots) generated by these systems. We are interested in how, in effect, the system developed historically and politically. Current tensions will also outline the course of future changes. It is our conviction that these systems generate the seeds to their own future development. Hence research will focus upon current dissatisfactions and hopes and will also ask informants to speculate on possible corrective measures and what the effects of such measures might be if taken. We will thereby obtain material with a continuity of time depth as well as comparative material from different circumpolar countries. As each country deals with the much the same issues from different vantage points in national policy, and increasingly through similar foundations ratified in international conventions, such research into the pros and cons of various regulatory systems is essential.",

We hypothesize that the interaction of these three variables largely determines the bottom-up control on these two dominant Southern Ocean phytoplankton taxa. Grazing and other loss processes will also be important variables in determining the relative dominance of these two taxa; however, the study proposed here will primarily focus on the bottom-up control mechanisms. It is important to understand such environmentally-driven taxonomic shifts in primary production, since they are expected to impact the fixation and export of carbon and nutrients, and the production of DMS, thus potentially providing both positive and negative feedbacks on climate.\n\nWithin the context of this proposal, we consider a range of ambient iron, light and pCO2 levels that span those typically observed in the Ross Sea during the growing season.  That is, dissolved iron ranging from ~0.1 nM (“low iron”) to >1 nM (“high iron”) (Fitzwater et al. 2000; Sedwick et al. 2000); mean irradiance (resulting from vertical mixing/self shading) ranging from <10% Io (“low light”) to >40% (“high light”) (Arrigo et al., 1998, 1999), which may be adjusted based on our field observations (see section 6.3.3); and pCO2 ranging (Sweeney et al. 2001) from ~150 ppm (“low CO2”) to the probable higher levels of pCO2 — 750 ppm as a conservative estimate — that are likely to be attained later this century due to anthropogenic perturbation of the global carbon cycle (IPCC, 2001).\n\nFrom the information currently available from both field observations and experiments, we have formulated the following specific hypotheses regarding the interactive role of iron, light and CO2 in regulating algal composition in the Ross Sea.  Principally, we propose that diatoms bloom in the southern Ross Sea only under optimum conditions of high iron, light and pCO2; colonial Phaeocystis dominate under conditions of high iron with either (or both) low light or low pCO2; and solitary Phaeocystis are predominant under conditions of low iron with either (or both) low light or low pCO2.  Two cruises are planned to investigate the interactions between the primary productivity of the Ross Sea and pCO2, iron and other trace elements. \n\nSummary provided by http://www.whoi.edu/sbl/liteSite.do?litesiteid=2530&articleId=4191",

Such work will allow for both local indigenous peoples and researchers to document changes in the biodiversity of char populations and their local ecosystems and to link their findings into a comprehensive view of global change as it affects this key Arctic fishery resource. During the IPY period (2006-2008) this activity will: a) establish a network and outreach among northern communities, char researchers, conservation groups, and other IPY projects; b) research and/or summarise present local and global biodiversity in chars; c) develop appropriate monitoring protocols for char status and diversity; and, d) establish relevant local and global monitoring/research sites and teams in as many Arctic countries as possible. Using these IPY short-term products as the background, the long-term goals are to establish long-term funding for the Network, extend it to un- or under-represented areas, and establish legacy databases and trained individuals, assessment schedules, and monitoring approaches and research topics suitable for long-term monitoring and research. This activity is fundamental to the conservation and sustainability of this pivotal arctic aquatic resource and will contribute to this by documenting present status and impacts on this fish and its Arctic ecosystems, project future status, and provide the foundation for adaptation strategies designed to meet challenges of change in the Arctic.\nFurther, this activity is a direct response fulfilling a specific aim and initiative of the Arctic Council as follows. In its acceptance of the findings and projections from the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA), the Arctic Council directed two of its working groups, Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) and Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) to examine the ACIA findings and develop follow-on programmes and activities, both individually and jointly, to address key projections for the future of the Arctic. A primary response of the CAFF working group was the implementation of the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Programme (CBMP, IPY133) formally released in September, 2005 (http://www.caff.is). The CBMP calls for the development of a number of specific networks designed to monitor the status and change of key Arctic organisms of primary importance to the integrity of Arctic ecosystems and the culture and livelihood of indigenous peoples. Arctic char was specifically designated by the CBMP as a target species for monitoring the general health and biodiversity of Arctic aquatic ecosystems. Results and activities from this char network will contribute directly to CBMP work; furthermore, additional networks (e.g., Freshwater Biodiversity, IPY202) and specific research endeavours (e.g., Arctic char thermal habitat use; IPY 144) developed through IPY stimulus are directly linked to this IPY proposal (i.e., lead on this project, J. Reist, is a member of the CBMP, and is a co-lead (144) or named participant (202) of other projects). A component of this project is also linked to the IPY Youth project (IPY168). This proposed network is also tightly linked to established existing char researchers (i.e. International Society of Arctic char Fanatics, ISACF IPY project co-lead, J. Hammar, is principal of ISACF and J. Reist is a long-time member).\nChars are a group of closely related fish species that collectively form a key renewable resource for northern peoples from the sub-Arctic through to the northernmost freshwaters of all Arctic nations. Chars exhibit great biodiversity both within and among locations (e.g., ecological forms, life history types, etc.). These forms may act as distinct ecological 'species' in Arctic systems thus contribute to ecosystem stability and resilience. Chars also may occupy and migrate among many habitats during their life history, thus are key components of, and linking entities between, freshwater (both lakes and rivers), estuarine, and near-shore ecosystems. Chars are usually apex predators within their ecosystems thus they integrate lower-level ecosystem impacts. Chars are highly responsive to many anthropogenic impacts and are pivotal integrators of both short-term (e.g., exploitation, contaminants, habitat change, industrial development) and long-term (e.g., climate variability and change) direct effects both on themselves and indirect effects on their ecosystems. Chars are also widely fished supporting local food, commercial and sport fisheries as well as northern aquaculture endeavours. Thus, chars are of primary interest to northern peoples as a key resource, hence interest and involvement of community-based monitoring is high. Accordingly, chars are useful both as monitors of ecosystem change and for understanding responses of northern resources and ecosystems to anthropogenic drivers at many temporal and spatial levels. This network will provide the basis for integrating these activities throughout the Arctic thereby establishing a lasting legacy for a key northern renewable resource.",

The ongoing warming of Arctic regions will lead to a northward retreat of the MIZ, and to an earlier opening of huge areas in spring. This may result in a temporal mismatch between the phytoplankton spring bloom and zooplankton reproduction. Less ice will also reduce the ice algae production that may be an important food source for spawning zooplankton prior to the phytoplankton spring bloom. Quantity and quality of primary production in seasonally ice-covered seas is primarily regulated by light and nutrients. Excess light, however, is potentially detrimental for algae and can reduce algal food quality. A decrease in the relative amount of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in algae due to excess light may affect the reproductive success and growth of zooplankton, and thereby the transport of energy to higher trophic levels, such as fish, birds, and mammals. We will carry out an extensive field campaign in spring, land based in the high Arctic fjord Rijpfjorden (Nordaustlandet, Svalbard), to follow the development in biomass and food quality of ice algae, phytoplankton and secondary production before, under and after ice break up. The copepod Calanus glacialis, the key herbivore in Arctic shelf seas will be used as target species for secondary production. The role of PUFAs for the reproductive success of Calanus, as well as the algal potential for acclimation to high and shifting light intensities will be studied in controlled laboratory experiments in Ny Ålesund (Marine Laboratory) and Longyearbyen (UNIS). Ultimately, this study aims to predict food web effects of reduced ice concentrations and ice cover in Arctic shelf seas, such as the Barents Sea.",

The program\nwas initiated by local governments and citizens who saw a need for a better\ninformation base for use in managing natural resources and in planning for\ndevelopment.  In response to these concerns, the Governors of Oregon and\nWashington requested in 1974 that the Pacific Northwest River Basins Commission\n(PNRBC) undertake an interdisciplinary ecological study of the estuary.  At\napproximately the same time, local governments and port districts formed the\nColumbia River Estuary Study Taskforce (CREST) to develop a regional management\nplan for the estuary.\nCREDDP was designed to meet the needs of those groups who were expected to be\nthe principal users of the information being developed.  One group consisted of\ngovernment officials and others involved in planning.  The other group was\nresearchers and educators.  The ecological research in CREDDP focuses on the\nlinkages among different elements in the food web and the influence on that web\nof such physical processes as currents, sediment transport, and salinity\nintrusion.\nResearch was divided into thirteen projects, called work units.  Three work\nunits, Emergent Plant Primary Production, Benthic Primary Production, and Water\nColumn Primary Production, dealt with the plant life which, through\nphotosynthesis and uptake of chemical nutrients, forms the base of the esturine\nfood web.  The goals of these work units were to describe and map the\nproductivity and biomass patterns of the estuary's primary producers and to\ndescribe the relationship of physical factors to primary producers and their\nproductivity levels.\nThe higher trophic levels in the estuarine food web were the focus of seven\nCREDDP work units: Zooplankton and Larval Fish, Benthic Infauna, Epibenthic\nOrganisms, Fish, Avifauna, Wildlife, and Marine Mammals.  The goals of these\nwork units were to describe and map the abundance patterns of the invertebrate\nand vertebrate species and to describe these species' relationships to relevant\nphysical factors.\nThe other three work units, Sedimentation and Shoaling, Currents, and\nSimulation, dealt with physical processes.  The work unit goals were to\ncharacterize and map bottom sediment distribution, to characterize sediment\ntransport, and to determine the cause of bathymetric change, and to determine\nand model circulation patterns, vertical mixing and salinity patterns.\nFinal reports on all these thirteen work units have been published.

            "definition": "Mission Overview\n The joint U.S./Argentinian Aquarius/Satélite de Aplicaciones Científicas (SAC)-D mission will map the salinity—the concentration of dissolved salt—at the ocean surface, information critical to improving our understanding of two major components of Earth's climate system: the water cycle and ocean circulation. By measuring ocean salinity from space, Aquarius will provide new insights into how the massive natural exchange of freshwater between the ocean, atmosphere and sea ice influences ocean circulation, weather and climate.\n\nBecause ocean surface salinity varies from place to place and over time, scientists can use it to trace the ocean's role in Earth's water cycle. For example, more than 85 percent of global evaporation and more than 75 percent of global precipitation occur over the ocean. By measuring changes in ocean surface salinity caused by these processes, as well as by ice melting and river runoff, Aquarius/SAC-D will provide important new information about how Earth's freshwater moves between the ocean and atmosphere and around the globe.\n\nKnowing ocean surface salinity can also help scientists track ocean currents and better understand ocean circulation. Salinity, together with temperature, determines how dense and buoyant seawater is. This, in turn, drives how ocean waters are layered and mixed and the formation of water masses. Salinity also has a major effect on ocean circulation, including the flow of currents that move heat from the tropics to the poles.\n\nAquarius/SAC-D will provide essential ocean surface salinity data needed to link the water cycle and ocean circulation—two major components of the climate system. This information, in turn, will help scientists improve the accuracy of computer climate models.\n\nGlobal ocean salinity has been an area of much scientific uncertainty. Past measurements of salinity have been limited mostly to summertime observations in shipping lanes. Recently, a European mission has begun making ocean surface salinity measurements. With the launch of Aquarius/SAC-D, scientists will collect more data in the mission's first few months than had been amassed by ships and in-water sensors during the previous 125 years.\n\nScheduled for launch no earlier than June 2011, Aquarius/SAC-D is designed to measure ocean surface salinity for at least three years, repeating its global pattern every seven days. During its lifetime, the mission will provide monthly maps of global changes in ocean surface salinity with a resolution of 150 kilometers (93 miles), showing how salinity changes from month-to-month, season-to-season and year-to-year. The spacecraft will fly in a sun-synchronous orbit 657 kilometers (408 miles) above Earth's surface.\n\nNASA's Aquarius is the primary instrument on the SAC-D spacecraft. It consists of three passive microwave radiometers to detect the surface emission that is used to obtain salinity and an active scatterometer to measure the ocean waves that affect the precision of the salinity measurement. While salinity levels in the open ocean generally range from 32 to 37 practical salinity units, or psu (roughly equivalent to parts per thousand), the Aquarius sensor will be able to detect changes in salinity as small as 0.2 psu. This is equivalent to about a 'pinch' (i.e., 1/8 of a teaspoon) of salt in one gallon of water.\n\nAquarius/SAC-D is a collaboration between NASA and Argentina's space agency, Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE), with participation from Brazil, Canada, France and Italy. The Aquarius instrument was jointly built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. JPL will manage Aquarius through the mission's commissioning phase and will archive mission data. Goddard will manage the mission's operations phase and process Aquarius science data. NASA's Launch Services Program at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida is managing the launch. CONAE is providing the SAC-D spacecraft, an optical camera, a thermal camera in collaboration with Canada, a microwave radiometer, sensors developed by various Argentine institutions, and the mission operations center in Argentina. France and Italy are also contributing instruments.",

Palmer. The Palmer is one of two icebreakers leased by the National Science Foundation and is dedicated almost entirely to conducting scientific research in the Southern Ocean. This 58-day cruise left from Hobart Tasmania and returned to port in Capetown South Africa, after transiting nearly a quarter of the way around the perimeter of Antarctica. Along the way, nearly a quarter mile of sediment core was recovered from seven deep shelf basins, with the goal of developing a record of climate and oceanographic change during the Quaternary. Although the pace of recent climate change appears to be more rapid and of a larger scale in Antarctica compared to other areas of the globe, the factors forcing climate change in Antarctica are not well understood, due to the relative inaccessibility of the southernmost continent and the inhospitable working conditions. In order to address this scarcity of samples, particularly from the eastern side of the continent, we devoted our two months of ship time to acquiring as much data as possible. Most of the sediment core material was recovered with the 'Jumbo Piston Corer,' a 90-foot long, 5' diameter, assembly of steel barrels, plastic core liner, and lead weights. Core sites were selected based on a combination of sub-bottom profiling and seafloor bathymetric mapping of well stratified and undisturbed acoustic reflectors. Back in the lab, our group has been responsible for two lines of investigation. First, we develop paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on microscopic analysis of diatoms, single celled algae with a hard silica skeleton that serves as a permanent record of past climate. Second, we work with the sea floor maps to decipher the geologic processes that have shaped the seabed. Natalie, Caroline and Meredith worked with both Charlie and Amy as well as with our colleagues from other institutions, on senior projects based on the data collected during the cruise. Their contribution to the success of this cruise has been invaluable. Geology undergrads will continue the detailed analysis for the next few years as we extract the clearest indicators of Antarctic margin climate change from the core samples. \n\nSummary provided by http://departments.colgate.edu/geology/research/levant.htm?FDSID=331",

The USGCRP, in collaboration with several other national and international science programs, has documented and characterized several important aspects of the sources, abundances and lifetimes of greenhouse gases; has mounted extensive space-based monitoring systems for global-wide monitoring of climate and ecosystem parameters; has begun to address the complex issues of various aerosol species that may significantly influence climate parameters; has advanced our understanding of the global water and carbon cycles (but with major remaining uncertainties); and has developed several approaches to computer modeling of the global climate.\n\nBecause of the scientific accomplishments achieved by USGCRP and other research programs during a productive &period of discovery and characterization& since 1990, we are now ready to move into a new\n&period of differentiation and strategy investigation&, which is the theme of the President&#039;s Climate Change Research Initiative (CCRI). In announcing the CCRI, the President directed the reestablishment of priorities for climate change research, including a focus on identifying the scientific information that can be developed within 2 to 5 years to assist the nation&#039;s evaluation of optimal strategies to address global change risks.

The coastal margin hosts a complex interaction of marine, terrestrial and atmospheric processes that are extremely vulnerable to predicted environmental changes and anthropogenic stressors. These high-latitude coasts are typically permafrost-dominated and suffer from rapid erosion with serious implications for ecosystems and communities (Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) - key finding #5). Furthermore, changes in inputs of water and constituents (nutrients, sediments, dissolved inorganic matter and contaminants) from major Arctic rivers have the potential to fundamentally alter biogeochemical cycling and productivity in the coastal zone and in the Arctic marginal seas (continental shelves). Changes in the Arctic coastal zone, including coastal erosion and riverine fluxes, will not only affect regional biological and human systems, but are also likely to influence the global system. For example, degradation of coastal and offshore permafrost may lead to the release of greenhouse gases (GHG), and increases in freshwater inputs may alter regional as well as large-scale ocean circulation and climate patterns. To detect and quantify trajectories in coastal/shelf systems, their components and transformations must first be monitored. A coordinated monitoring programme incorporating diverse regions and providing site-specific, fine-scale baseline and time-series data will yield maximum value, facilitating local and circum-Arctic studies, such as validation of multiscale biodiversity and coastal community models. \n\nTo address these issues, it is proposed that an internationally coordinated circum-Arctic network of coastal and marginal seas observatories (~20 key sites including deltas and estuaries of major Siberian and North American rivers) be established within the IPY 2007-2008 framework based on ecoregion representation criteria. The sites will be loci for multi-disciplinary, multi-resolution studies set within a broader eco- and socio-regional frame of reference and will include sensitive areas with varying degrees of human impact. Site selection will be coordinated with local communities and will build upon existing monitoring programmes and data availability. In particular, the circum-Arctic coastal key sites established within the IASC/IPA/IGBP-LOICZ project Artic Coastal Dynamics (ACD), the river monitoring stations installed at down-stream locations on the 6 largest rivers draining the pan-Arctic watershed (Yenisey, Lena, Ob, Kolyma, Yukon, Mackenzie) as part of the NSF-ARCSS Freshwater Initiative (FWI), and the pilot version of the Hudson Bay Complex Observatory (MERICA) will be considered.\n\nThe recommended strategy is outlined in five steps:\n(1) Initial site characterisation and representation assessment: \n(a) acquisition of comprehensive, high-resolution imagery of the circum-Arctic coastline, (\nb) physical (atmospheric, terrestrial, inter-tidal and marine coastal conditions), \n(c) ecological (marine and terrestrial classification, habitat mapping, assessment of biodiversity indicators and components), \n(d) biogeochemical fluxes of major and minor elements and greenhouse gases \n(e) Socio-economic (general situation, interaction of resource users, assessment of resources used, local knowledge of coastal processes, state of legal and administrative regulations);\n\n(2) Monitoring of changes: \n(a) physical (atmospheric and oceanographic forcing, permafrost parameters, coastal terrestrial and marine morphology, riverine fluxes), \n(b) ecological (habitats, biodiversity, living resource assessment) \n(c) biogeochemistry, (C, N, and gas fluxes, environmental quality, biological production and biogeochemical cycles), \n(d) socio-economic (industrial production, plans and potential constraints for development, quality of life, local economy, population and demography, social problems of native peoples);\n\n(3) Data analyses: \n(a) change detection, \n(b) identification of interdependencies amongst physical, biological, social, and ecological parameters; \n\n(4) Data/information management: \n(a) metadata standards, \n(b) Arctic spatial data infrastructure, \n(c) web accessible databases and products (e.g. maps), \n(d) data accessibility to local and scientific communities;\n\n(5) Synthesis: formulation of models at multiple levels (conceptual to regional and global numerical) incorporating interdependent physical, biological and environmental changes in response to natural and anthropogenic forcing, development of response strategies.",

The project examined the role of these ice\nstreams as buffers between the interior ice and the floating ice shelves. The\nreasons for their fast flow, the factors controlling their current\ngrounding-line-, margin-, and head-positions are crucial to any attempt at\nmodeling the WAIS system and predicting the future of the ice sheet. For the\nAntarctic ice streams of the Siple Coast, the transition from no-sliding (or\nall internal deformation) to motion dominated by sliding is defined as the\n'onset-region'. To fully understand (and adequately model) the WAIS, this onset\nregion must be better understood. The lateral margins of the ice streams are\nalso a transition that need better explanation. Hypotheses on controls of the\nlocation of the onset region range from the 'purely-glaciologic' to the\n'purely-geologic. Thus, to model the ice sheet accurately, the basal boundary\nconditions (roughness, wetness, till properties) and a good subglacial geologic\nmap, showing the distribution, thickness, and properties of the sedimentary\nbasins, are required. These parameters can be estimated from seismic, radar,\nand other geophysical methods. The transition region of ice stream D was\nstudied in detail with this coupled geophysical experiment. In addition,\nselected other locations on ice streams C & D were made, in order to compare\nand contrast conditions with the main site on ice stream D. Site-selection for\nthe main camp wasbased on existing radar, GPS, and satellite data as well as\ninput from the modeling community.",

That field experiment, in the vicinity of NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC), is being conducted to both validate the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) satellite measurements, and investigate lightning activity and its relationship to storm morphology. The ACES payload, already developed and flown on ALTUS, includes several electrical, magnetic, and optical sensors to remotely characterize the lightning activity and the electrical environment within and around thunderstorms.\n\nThis summary is from http://aces.msfc.nasa.gov/about.html",

It is the most extreme ocean in regard to the seasonality of light and its year-round existing ice cover. Current knowledge indicates that the Arctic seas hold a multitude of unique life forms highly adapted in their life history, ecology and physiology to the extreme and seasonal conditions of their environment. Our knowledge of what currently lives in the Arctic Ocean is still rudimentary compared to most other regions, due to the logistical challenges imposed by its multiyear ice and inhospitable climate. \n\nThe Arctic Ocean is also the area where the impact of climate change might be strongest expressed. The already on-going changes make the effort to identify the diversity of life in the major three realms (sea ice, water column and sea floor) an urgent issue. Changes in the environmental conditions will have direct effects on the marine biota on multiple scales, from communities and populations to individuals. Species level information is, therefore, essential to discussions on climate change or anthropogenic impact, their expressions and effects. These effects can only be detected through long-term monitoring of key species, communities and processes. For monitoring and assessment of changes, the availability of baseline data is crucial.\n\nThe Census of Marine Life is implementing a project aimed at documenting the present Arctic Ocean Biodiversity (PDF download) using an international Pan-Arctic view. The operational approach is for coordinated research efforts, designed to examine the diversity in each of the major three realms: sea ice, water column and sea floor. This program will consolidate what is known and fill remaining gaps in our knowledge: it aims for active participation in the International Polar Year 2007/2008. ArcOD was listed as lead for the Arctic Ocean diversity cluster by ICSU. Most recent research efforts in the Arctic Ocean focus on processes. The emphasis of this program is on biodiversity, because processes are critically impacted by the composition of biota involved in them.\n\nThis summary is from http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/research/arcdiv/index.html",

It has been illustrated that in Polar Regions, concentrations of some semi-volatile contaminants may become elevated due to the cold-condensation effect. Global warming is also expected to alter contaminant dynamics and fate in polar regions although the magnitude and nature of these effects is difficult to predict. Because many of these contaminants, like organochlorines, exhibit toxicity and are persistent, they pose a risk to organisms that reside in Polar Regions. For the AE this has been shown, see for instance the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) in which some partners of the current consortium participated. For an assessment of the extent of contamination in the Polar Regions, and associated risks, information is needed on routes of transport to Polar Regions, fate of contaminants in Polar Regions and food web uptake and levels in biota, preferably combined with spatial and temporal trends. This EoI is a combined effort in order to assess this in a multi-disciplinary way, in an international consortium, focused on both Polar Regions. Within the EoI two research pillars are defined: 1) on the transport and fate of contaminants to and in Polar Regions, 2) on the food web transfer and contaminant status of higher organisms. \n\nResearch pillar 1: atmospheric transport, deposition and photochemistry à input to Polar Regions\nIn order to address the occurrence and routes of transport to Polar Regions, an international circumpolar network will be established to document contaminant deposition to terrestrial Arctic/Antarctic environments, using the moss/lichen monitoring approach and snow-sampling approaches coupled with passive POPs samplers. This network will build upon passive sampling devices in co-operation with the Global Atmospheric Passive Sampling (GAPS) Project, but also on in situ passive biomonitors (lichens and mosses). It builds on the work of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) in advancing our understanding of spatial patterns of contaminant deposition in the Arctic, and adds an Antarctic module. It is linked to other IPY EoI&#039;s and full proposals like OASIS, GOA and ATMOPOL. The work will fill knowledge gaps defined by successful ongoing Arctic programs (Northern Contaminants Program and Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme) and contribute to development and validation of models used to predict contaminant transport and deposition.\n\nResearch pillar 2: food web transfer and risks\nThe focus of this initiative will be to document recent trends and derive conclusions on the nature of contaminant biotransport through diverse trophic level pathways of polar food web and to compare/contrast contaminant distributions and bioaccumulation for Antarctic and Arctic food webs. Integrated bipolar research, using similar methods, will be highly beneficial to both regions. The AAE has very little anthropogenic influence and may therefore act as reference for the AE, while for AE more toxicity data is available, which may be extrapolated to the Antarctic region. The following topics will be addressed: trophic magnification factors for predator-prey species in AAE and AE (food web transfer to birds and mammals, including ringed seals in the AE), comparison of compound patterns and levels in Antarctica with the Arctic, spatial and temporal trends between and within AAE and AE, emerging contaminants and toxicity assessment at lower trophic levels, especially for Antarctic species. Contaminants in combination with dietary descriptors (for instance stable isotopes) will be used as ecological markers to enhance the understanding of the polar marine food web and trophic relations, which account for the elevated level of contaminants at higher trophic levels. For the AAE, specific attention will be drawn to the role of stations in the local contamination of the environment.\nThe research will be designed such that the overall outcome of the project will be an integrated picture of new knowledge on routes and mode of transport to Polar Regions, and uptake and food web transfer in Polar Ecosystems. Integration of Arctic and Antarctic data will enable comparisons between the regions, but will also use the specific values of the data of the two regions (Antarctica being perhaps a better reference site, Arctic region with more toxicity data).",

The stable atmosphere, due to its\ngenerally weak or intermittent turbulence (`bursting'), is the source\nof a number of outstanding problems in atmospheric science,\nagricultural meteorology, and signal propagation, amongothers. As\nsuch, CASES-99 focussed it's Intense Observing Periods during the\nclear sky, light near-surface wind, nocturnal boundary layer (NBL)\nconditions, which are conducive to stable (Ri > 0.25) and very stable\nconditions (Ri > 1.0).

This area was chosen\nfor CASES-99 due to its relative lack of obstacles, relatively flat\nterrain (average slopes are 0.5 degrees), and reasonable access to\npower and phone lines. A large number of instrumentswill be deployed\nin a an area 4.8 x 3.2 km, to capture stable NBL heterogeneity, with\nsome outlying instrumentation.

We have developed\na program called AnSlope to address this problem. Our primary goal is to\nidentify the principal physical processes that govern the transfer of\nshelf-modified dense water into intermediate and deep layers of the adjacent\ndeep ocean. At the same time, we seek to understand the compensatory poleward\nflow of waters from the oceanic regime. We identify the upper continental slope\nas the critical gateway for the exchange of shelf and deep ocean waters. Here\nthe topography, velocity and density fields associated with the nearly\nubiquitous Antarctic Slope Front (ASF) must strongly influence the advective\nand turbulent transfer of water properties between the shelf and oceanic\nregimes.\n\nAnSlope has four specific objectives: [A] Determine the ASF mean structure and\nthe principal scales of variability (spatial from ~1 km to ~100 km, and\ntemporal from tidal to seasonal), and estimate the role of the Front on\ncross-slope exchanges and mixing of adjacent water masses; [B] Determine the\ninfluence of slope topography (canyons, proximity to a continental boundary,\nisobath divergence/convergence) on frontal location and outflow of dense Shelf\nWater; [C] Establish the role of frontal instabilities, benthic boundary layer\ntransports, tides and other oscillatory processes on cross-slope advection and\nfluxes; and [D] Assess the effect of diapycnal mixing (shear-driven and\ndouble-diffusive), lateral mixing identified through intrusions, and\nnonlinearities in the equation of state (thermobaricity and cabbeling) on the\nrate of descent and fate of outflowing, near-freezing Shelf Water.\n\nAnSlope addresses these objectives with an integrated observational and\nmodeling program structured as follows. A collaborative core program begins in\n2002, containing the components considered central to meeting AnSlope\nobjectives, primarily through acquisition of a set of measurements focused over\nthe outer continental shelf and upper slope of the northwestern Ross Sea. This\nwill allow us to assess the regional AABW production rate, and to identify the\ncross-front exchange processes that must be taken into account when assessing\nprovision of dense water to the deep basins elsewhere around Antarctica. The\ncore elements are: moorings; CTD/LADCP and CTD-based microstructure; tracers;\nand basic tidal modeling. 'Enhancement' proposals, to be submitted separately,\nrequest support for the modeling studies that are necessary to fully exploit\nthe measurements and develop the techniques for parameterizing cross-front\nexchanges in regional and global models. Three cruises are proposed, beginning\nin Austral summer 2003, over a period of 12 to 14 months. Moorings would be in\nplace throughout this period. The Italian CLIMA program in the Ross Sea\nprovides a valuable international enhancement for the AnSlope observational\ncomponent. The German BRIOS-2 coupled ice-ocean GCM program is complementary to\nthe US process-oriented modeling studies, and provides a test-bed for\nAnSlope-generated parameterizations of cross-front exchange.\n\nAdditional information can be found at\n'http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/projects/anslope.shtml'",

The task is as herculean as it is important.\n\nAustralian research into Antarctic marine biology began in the late 1970s, spurred on by the establishment of the international BIOMASS (Biological Investigations into Marine Antarctic Systems and Stocks) Program. Driven by the development of a fishery for krill, BIOMASS looked at the distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill, seeking information on the interrelationships between krill and the other elements of the marine ecosystem.\n\nAustralian Antarctic marine research was made feasible by the conversion of the supply ship Nella Dan into a functional research vessel, in which the Australian Antarctic Division made its first concerted forays into open ocean research. Australia was a participant in the highly successful 1981 First International BIOMASS experiment (FIBEX) – the first attempt to survey the distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill using acoustic techniques. The results from this huge effort, using 13 ships from 11 nations, were translated 10 years later into catch limits for the krill fishery in the Atlantic and South West Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean. The Second International BIOMASS Experiment (SIBEX) was fraught with logistic difficulties.\n\nSummary provided by http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=4305",

Over the last few decades many Canadian Arctic peoples have negotiated land claims and set up governance and structures to protect and enhance their knowledge, languages. This will cover the first theme of the three proposed for this project; namely the Dynamics of Governance and Local Authority. This includes issues such as self-determination, governance, economic change and community dynamics.\n\nSecondly, within this model specific health concerns will be addressed including diabetes, heart disease, HIV, cancer, mental health, injuries. In addition factors that contribute to health including genuine progress indicators, water, environmental health, ownership of health, addictions, lifestyle, technology impacts and cumulative effects will be explored. The second theme of this project, then covers Northern Health Indicators, which addresses issues such as unintentional/intentional injuries, mental health lifestyle (addictions), and genuine progress indicators.\n\nThis programme is also framed by having to understand the Arctic peoples’ health through diversity by brining in issues from the point of view gender, and youth. This will aid in animating the cultural and individual contributions. An overarching community driven, Arctic lead, health and wellness research network is proposed that facilitates and participates in health research activities during the IPY within a model in which the resiliency and diversity of Arctic peoples is highlighted to answer questions that will create healthy environments and improve the health of persons in the circumpolar Arctic\n\nThis Canadian led Network would link territories, countries, communities, researchers, research and data management and that would serve as an international Canadian led legacy for IPY. It will also ensure best practices for community based health and wellness research throughout the IPY. As well as create a legacy for health research in Circumpolar Health Research across the Circumpolar North.\n\nThe above will be done through the creation of a network which allows for communication and integration of knowledge from various sources including medical science, traditional knowledge, social sciences, environmental sciences, biological, sociological historical – to mention few. And these will allow the third theme Northern Populations in Transition to emerge where topics like environmental change, technology and traditional foods and medicines come to play a role in understanding Arctic health in broadest sense.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=183",

            "definition": "The Bering Strait connects the Pacific and Atlantic oceans via the Arctic Ocean. The Strait is currently only 50 meters deep. During low sea level stands produced by continental glaciation it was emergent, forming the Bering Land Bridge connection between North America and Asia. This is the only area on Earth where the circulation between ocean basins has been blocked and a migration corridor between continental landmasses has been opened by falling sea levels of the Pleistocene epoch. Scientific drilling to recover a proximal record of the region can be most promisingly recovered in the thick (> 3 km) basinal sequences of the Norton and Hope basins immediately to the south and north of the Strait. The sedimentary record of marine transgressions and regressions within the Bering Strait region that includes intercalated terrestrial lacustrine sediments would have the potential to resolve crucial questions regarding Bering Land Bridge paleoecology and climate change.\nFunds to conduct a workshop to identify, select and prioritize drilling sites in Bering Sea Shelf basins with the potential to contain thick sequences of alternating marine and terrestrial sediments was approved by Joint Oceanographic Institutions/United States Science Support Program (JOI/USSSP) . Workshop to be held 21-222 June, 2005. The workshop focused on key scientific questions, identification of drilling sites with the potential to answer these questions, discussing the most appropriate platform or platforms, proposal submissions, and multi-proxy analyses. Products of this workshop will include a discussion of the potential scientific gains, a list of recommended drilling sites, and, ultimately, proposals submitted to the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program.\nScientific issues included: Studies of global freshwater transport have demonstrated a net flux of water from the North Pacific to the North Atlantic through the Bering Strait at a rate of 0.8 Sverdrups per year which accounts for nearly one-third of the total freshwater input to the Arctic Ocean . Models indicate that increased flow of fresher North Pacific water through the submerged Bering Strait can also lead to suppression of NADW formation . The opening and closing of the Bering Strait clearly has global climatic implications with regard to the cause and the duration of glacial and interglacial climatic oscillations, yet the numerous and sometimes contradictory models cannot be adequately tested because an accurate chronology of the emergence and submergence of the Strait is lacking. Reconstruction of the sea level history of the Bering Strait, including the exact timing of the opening and closing of the land bridge and the rates of associated sea level changes, the presence/absence of sea/terrestrial ice, is essential to understanding its role as a trigger or pacemaker of northern hemisphere climate changes. The Bering Land Bridge served as an oscillating biological filter between marine and terrestrial for plants, animals, and humans that passed between Eurasia and North America during the Late Quaternary period. Previous exchanges of species between Asia and North America during the Miocene and Late Cretaceous indicate that the Bering Strait region experienced intervals of emergence prior to the Pleistocene. Intercontinental exchange and competition from foreign species has been sited as a causal factor in the Cretaceous, Eocene, and Pleistocene extinctions. It needs to be determined if there was a north-south and/or east west ecological gradient on the central land bridge? If so did the gradients varied in space and time?\nIn addition to organic remains, identification and dating of tephras contained within terrestrial or marine sediments of the Bering Strait will further enhance understanding of the chronology of Quaternary eruptions and their role in global climate variations. Geochemical characterization of tephras from Bering Strait cores could provide a record of the frequency, magnitude, and timing of eruptions at volcanoes of the Aleutian Arc, Seward Peninsula, and islands in Bering Sea. Furthermore, volcanic ash deposits are one of the only possible ways of demonstrating precise correlations between terrestrial and marine deposits throughout Beringia and the Bering Sea.\n. The workshop participants resolved that in order to address unresolved questions regarding global ocean circulation and rapid climate changes, and to permit reconstruction of the flora, fauna, and climate of the lowlands in the center of the Beringian subcontinent, basinal features that contain both marine and terrestrial lacustrine sediments must be targeted\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=29",

Ground-based sample collections will also be carried out in the Canadian north to gain a better understanding of the deposition of atmospheric contaminants and their movement through food chains leading to humans.\n\nThe objectives of this project are:\n-Establish an international database for sharing data between monitoring networks in collaborating countries.\n-Develop and extend atmospheric transport models to trace the movement of radionuclides and other contaminants from sources in temperate zones to remote Arctic locations\n-Demonstrate changing trends in atmospheric circulation to the Arctic and within the Arctic by using these contaminants as tracers of atmospheric processes. \n-Document changes in soil gas emanation due to changing permafrost conditions.\n-Examine the link between climate change and forest fires in the north\n-Contribute to an understanding of ozone depletion in the stratosphere and ozone chemistry at ground level.\n-Assess the impact of these changes on the movement of contaminants through Arctic ecosystems and particularly in food chains leading to humans.\n\nThe following ongoing and future studies will be carried out with the aid of air monitoring networks for radionuclides and other contaminants:\n-A study carried out in collaboration with Meteorological Services of Canada has traced the movement of iodine-129 from nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities in Siberia to remote locations in the Canadian Arctic. \n-Radioxenon from the reactor belt in eastern North America has been traced to Yellowknife, NWT. Measurements will be extended to include the long-lived krypton-85, a waste product from nuclear fuel reprocessing, in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions.\n-Cesium-137 released from wood-burning in distant forest fires has been detected at the Yellowknife location. Levoglucosan, a combustion product from forest fires, will also be measured on archived air filters to provide an historical record of forest fire effects. \n-Measurements of uranium, radium, lead-210, and potassium-40, and total dust loading will give information on intercontinental dust transport.\n-The short-lived radon and thoron decay products (lead-212, bismuth-214) are indicative of local emanations of soil gas and will be used to study changing permafrost conditions. \n-The beryllium isotopes (Be-7 and Be-10) are produced by cosmic irradiation of air molecules in the stratosphere. Their abundances and ratios at the earth's surface give information on exchanges of air masses between the stratosphere and troposphere, which are vulnerable to changing climate conditions.\n-Measurements of heavy metals (e.g., Hg, Cd) and selected organic compounds will extend the range of sources and pathways that can be studied and will aid in the understanding of atmospheric chemistry processes in the Arctic. \n\nDetails are still being worked out on the ground based studies. They will include collections of precipitation, soil, lichens, and higher plants to track the deposition of airborne contaminants and their movement through the food chain.",

It will increase capacity and effectiveness of the circum-Arctic monitoring through responding to the need of the long-term collection of data in remote Arctic locations, in particularly, in BSR that was identified as a priority monitoring area by many scientists, e.g. by the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Programme of the Arctic Council. The project will use IPY as an impetus to consolidate current research and jump-start new cooperative activities between scientists, indigenous and other citizens groups from the North East Russia and Alaska, U.S. Whereas, the region is known for an international cooperative research in specific species management, e.g. Gray whales and Polar bear, efforts on creation of circum-Bering Sea research interface have not been successful due to political and logistical reasons. BSSN will work specifically with community-based/place based research and will attempt to integrate these efforts with broader scientific activities in the region and globally.\nBSSN will consist of community-based and/or international regional organizations, primarily indigenous. In addition to the international organization (AIA, ICC, CAFF, UNEP), the list of initial partners will include five Alaska Natives regional non-profit organizations, eight regional organizations in Chukotka and Kamchatka in Russia, Alaska Native Science Commission and University of Alaska. The Network will cooperate with other organizations, projects and scientists from the cluster projects. The initial program activities will be based on the existing and emerging research and monitoring projects implemented by its partners. Examples of potential monitoring targets related to climate change, biodiversity and human health: shift of southern species north, changes in distribution and abundance of fish and other temperature-sensitive species, change in ice patterns, weather observations, contaminants presence in environment and traditional foods, weather related accidents, occurrence of infectious diseases.\nThe research activities that are currently undertaken in cooperation with scientists will continue in BSSN. This project will advance this work by scaling it up to the international level. It will create a system for sharing of the best practices of individual projects/organizations in the region and in the Arctic, will enable scientists to reach key areas in the region for collection of specific data and will improve standardized data management. \nThe Network will employ the following principles: ecosystem approach BSSN has ecosystem boundaries and the collected data will help better understand relationships between various elements of ecosystem; openness and transparency based on defined structure and management; use of the best available knowledge - western science and expertise derived from traditional and indigenous knowledge will be utilized. Local and indigenous experts, recognized as such in their respective communities, will be offered an opportunity to work side-by-side with scientists contributing to generate hypotheses, analyze empirical data, develop and perform research activities where appropriate. The network will consist of organizations, not projects, to ensure sustainability and continuity. \nIn 2006, BSSN will conduct a series of workshops to devise the Network management structure, logistics, memberships and means for sustainability. Work plans for activities assuring BSSN input to major IPY projects (CBMP, AHHI, and ESSAS via BEST and SEARCH, etc.) and output from independent thematic projects, e.g. ALISON, will be developed. A data management process will be established for the network. Alaska Native Science Commission and the University of Alaska will lead this work. The process will go through rigorous reviews by BSSN members and will conform to the standards/matrix developed by IPY data management services. \nInitial research activities may begin in 2006 with thematic observation systems based on current projects and will continue in 2007-08 with inclusion of new monitoring projects, e.g. invasive species or distribution of particular species. Such thematic networks could be developed for CBMP and other interested programs. The list of current projects includes: 1.) Oil spill monitoring, lead partner (LP) Aleutian Pribilof Island Association (APIA), funded; 2.) Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning, LP Aleut International Association, funding pending; 3.) Shark distribution changes, LP APIA, funding pending; 4.)Traditional food safety, LP APIA; 5.) Polar bear and whale hunting projects of the Alaska Chukotka development Program",

This will lead to an intensification of the Arctic hydrologic cycle. At regional scales, however, it remains unknown how precipitation, evaporation, and river discharge are evolving in a warmer world. This study will investigate the role of large-scale atmospheric anomalies in the Canadian northern hydrologic cycle with a focus on the IPY. Specifically, we will address the following science questions:\n\n1) What are the dominant large-scale atmospheric teleconnections that affect northern Canada?\n2) What is the role of these teleconnections and their relative contributions to the atmospheric and surface water budgets of high-latitude river basins in a changing environment?\n3) How will the meteorological and hydrological variables differ from their mean state during the IPY and how will they evolve in the near future?\n\nTo answer these important science questions, the following work will be conducted according to the proposed timeline:\n\n-2006-2007: Historical meteorological and hydrological data will be analysed. Relationships between atmospheric teleconnections such as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the state of the hydrologic budget over northern Canada will be evaluated. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis (ERA40) data set will provide global meteorological data that will be supplemented by observed river discharge from the Canadian Hydrometric Database (HYDAT) and observed precipitation and temperature from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia. The analysis will cover the period 1964-2004 for which spatial and temporal coverage is best and focus on the Mackenzie and Hudson Bay river basins.\n\n-2007-2008: During the IPY intensive observing period, real-time monitoring of the atmospheric teleconnection indexes and of the hydrologic budget in northern Canada will be maintained. The daily and recent state of atmospheric and hydrologic variables, including daily assessments of their deviations from the mean, will be reported on our website to provide other researchers this valuable information.\n\n-2008-2009: A diagnostic study of the atmospheric and hydrologic state over northern Canada during the IPY will be conducted. This work will focus on the anomalies during the IPY from the mean state (1964-2004). An assessment of trends in the atmospheric teleconnection indexes and in the hydrometeorological variables will provide insights on the possible future state of northern Canada’s hydrologic cycle.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details-print.php?id=159",

Basic research is centered on the investigation of the impact of relatively small-scale physical, biological, and chemical processes on near-surface spectral IOPs and AOPs. Some of the processes under investigation for the HyCODE project include advection of optically important material, phytoplankton growth and loss, bubble injection, sediment resuspension, fronts, and internal waves.

Human travel is occurring at an unprecedented level across the globe.\n\nCurrently alien microbes, fungi, plants and animals occur on some parts of the Antarctic continent and most of the sub-Antarctic islands. These have been transported to the region through human activity (Frenot et al 2005). Introduction routes are largely associated with movement of people and cargo in association with national scientific program and tourist operations (Whinam et al 2005). The impact of these alien species ranges from minor transient introduction to substantial loss of local biodiversity and changes to ecosystem processes and evolution. With rapid climate change occurring in some parts of Antarctica, greater numbers of alien introductions and more successful invasions by aliens are likely, with consequent increases in impacts on ecosystems (Bergstrom and Chown, 1999).\n\nThis project aims to assess the extent to which the annual migratory human population carry propagules (seeds, spores, eggs) of alien species unintendedly into the Antarctic region. It aims to take a snap shot of the propagule load during the first IPY summer. This project will be the first time that an assessment of the extent of transfer of alien species into an entire biome has ever been made. \n\nThis project will attempt to assess the propagule load carried by people on a large subsample of Antarctic voyages/flights into the Antarctic and subantarctic islands during the 2007/08 summer of IPY. Expeditioners' outer clothing and equipment will be inspected for propagules. Samples will be collected and identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible and using scaling- up procedures total propagule loads will be assessed. Furthermore recent travel histories of expeditioners will be taken, to assess potential sources of propagules. The significance of this element of the project is that propagules from cold areas such as the Arctic will have a greater chance of establishing in the Antarctic than those from warmer ecosystems.\n\nReferences\n\nWhinam, J., Chilcott N. & Bergstrom, D.M.

            "definition": "Arctic ecosystems are being strongly affected by global change and there is strong interest in being able to predict ecosystem responses to disturbance and for developing viable strategies for conserving biodiversity and managing the consequences of climate changes. Several international initiatives have been implemented to monitor and study the response to global warming of some tundra ecosystem components such as plants or permafrost. However, similar internationally-coordinated efforts for research on arctic food webs focusing on wildlife species (i.e. birds and mammals) are lacking. Yet, arctic food webs throughout the circumpolar world generally contain few species and are often dominated by the same groups of species, and so lend themselves well as systems suitable for comparative research. Our project will focus on key species of herbivores (e.g. geese, lemmings, and muskox), insectivores (e.g. shorebirds), and predators (e.g. foxes, snowy owls, falcons, gulls, and jaegers), and their interactions at a large number of arctic sites across North America and Eurasia. There will be a special effort in providing data from the winter period, which is poorly described in the Arctic. A primary objective is to document patterns of abundance, distribution, and phenology of reproduction of these species over large spatial and temporal scales using standardized protocols. These patterns will be related to local and regional climatic conditions. A secondary objective is to determine the relative importance of bottom-up (resources) and top-down (predators) forces in structuring these arctic food webs, and how climate affects these trophic linkages. Lemmings, which form the backbone of the terrestrial food web of the arctic, fluctuate cyclically in many locations, reaching peaks every 3-4 years. These cycles are reflected in cyclic abundance of specialist predators such as arctic foxes, snowy owls, jaegers, and weasels, which in turn may affect production of alternative prey like geese and shorebirds. Some of these complex interactions have been studied locally (Gauthier et al. 2004), but there have been few quantitative regional surveys to investigate synchrony among independent populations. In particular, we do not know how much synchrony occurs between or within continents, and this will affect how predators can operate within these polar ecosystems (Krebs et al. 2002). Geese and shorebirds are migratory birds using the Arctic only for summer breeding and offer an interesting contrast. Many goose populations have increased worldwide in recent decades, and goose grazing now has a large impact on several arctic wetlands. Although their population increase is largely fuelled by events occurring on their wintering grounds, they impose a large allochthonous influence on the tundra that seriously impacts ecosystem functioning (Abrahams et al. 2005, Gauthier et al. 2005). In contrast, many shorebird species appear to be declining worldwide, largely for unknown reasons (International Wader Study Group 2003). Shorebirds are a vital component of Arctic biodiversity with 37 species present in various parts of the circumpolar Arctic, but their globe-spanning migrations put their populations more at risk than most other species. Indeed, as global change will occur at varying speed and intensity at different latitudes, they will face multiple threats throughout their annual range, posing unique challenges for conservation. Arctic foxes are key predators of the arctic tundra that feed mostly on lemmings and birds. Their habitats have been recently invaded by red foxes in many parts of Eurasia and North America. Global warming should exacerbate this pattern but consequences on the arctic food chain are currently unknown. Foxes constitute a prime example of the changes in community structure that probably awaits the arctic tundra. Our project will build on arctic sites that already have a history of monitoring the wildlife species described in this proposal (core sites). Other sites will be added for the duration of IPY to expand the spatial coverage to poorly-known areas of the tundra (secondary sites). Inclusion of sites that lack some significant components of the arctic biota (e.g. islands without lemmings, geese or weasels) should allow fruitful comparisons to understand the role of these species in the arctic ecosystem. The abundance and distribution of all relevant species will be determined annually using the same technique at all sites. For birds, this will be largely determined by finding the nests of breeding individuals, which will also provide information on phenology. Similarly, for foxes this will be based on finding and monitoring active dens. For lemmings, various trapping techniques (snap and live-trapping) will be used. We will take blood, hair or feather samples from vertebrates (especially nomadic predators) for genetic and isotopic analysis to better understand population differentiation and trophic linkages. Exclosures will be built to monitor resource availability for herbivores, and their grazing impact. Insects will also be sampled to determine their seasonal abundance for insectivorous birds. Radio-tracking of some species will be used to monitor patterns of habitat use and activity. Winter work of resident arctic species will rely on direct observations or remote techniques (e.g. satellite or GPS radio-tracking). Climatic data will also be recorded at most sites year-round using automated stations. Our leading principle will be to collect data and to conduct experiments using a set of standard protocols that will allow comparison across all sites, and eventually meta-analyses of data from several sites.Abrahams, KF et al. 2005.

With the ratification of the Stockholm POPs protocol the Arctic has become a strategic location with which to monitor global contaminants. Polar bears are top arctic predators, and hunted regularly by indigenous people, which so far has not been a threat to the stability of circumpolar subpopulation numbers. Polar bears are also captured and released for various research and monitoring porojects and thus accessible for biosampling. Polar bears are therefore ideal biomonitors of spatial and temporal distribution, dynamics, fate, biomagnification and potential effects of legacy and emerging organic contaminants of anthropogenic origin and present in the arctic environment. Furthermore, polar bears are indicators of ecosystem health and environmental change such as in sea ice habitat due to global warming. POPs and mercury and their concentrations in polar bear fat have been corelated to a number of biomarker endpoints of various effects including bone density, histology of immunological organs, renal lesions, liver morphology, immune function and/or hormones in polar bears from Svalbard, East Greenland and the Canadian Arctic.\n\nPolar bears are exposed to a wide range of organohalogen contaminants at relatively high concentrations because of their high trophic level dependence as well as their preference to the blubber of their prey. For example, POP studies carried out in the circumpolar Arctic have shown high levels of selected POPs in polar bears from especially East Greenland, Svalbard and Russian Arctic. The highest levels POPs such as oxychlordane, trans-nonachlor and p,p-DDE were found in bears from Franz Josef Land and Kara Sea in the Russian Arctic. Polar bears from the Western Russian Arctic are exposed to higher levels of chlordanes and p,p-DDE than polar bears from locations westwards and eastwards from this region. Bears from the Western Russian Arctic (Franz Josef Land and Kara Sea) also had highest PCB levels compared to Svalbard, East Siberian and Chukchi Sea. A number of POPs such as PBDE, PFOS and chlorinated compounds are expected to increase to high levels.\n\nBy 2007-2008 it will be almost a decade since the last semi-circumpolar assessment of the spatial and temporal distribution of legacy and emerging POPs, and their metabolic by-products, was conducted in polar bears. Furthermore, the last truly circumpolar assessment, including bears from the Russian Arctic, will have been at least 15 years past. Emerging contaminants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and other brominated flame retardant compounds and perfluorinated compounds, have also yet to be determined in polar bears from the Russian Arctic. In addition, two related IPY pre-proposals are also being submitted, with essentially the same international, collaborative team, to assess the circumpolar, spatial and temporal distribution of legacy and emerging contaminants - including the rising mercury levels in the Western Arctic - in polar bear and ringed seal (blubber), which is the major dietary species for polar bears. \n\nTherefore, we propose to examine region-specific effect parameters (histology on internal organs, bone morphology) from necropsy samples taken via local Inuit hunters and haematology samples from the on-going telemetry studies, clitoris biopsies and rectal, vaginal and tracheal swabs and blood samples for bacteriology/virology, cytology and parasitology, vitamin and hormone profiles. These will be linked to the potential relationship between regionally bioaccumulation differences for the organohalogen contaminants and mercury levels. Fatty acid profiles and stable isotopes will also be determined to assess region-specific similarities and differences in polar bear diets linked to habitat climate factors - such as ice extent - from climate changes. Futhermore, genetical analysis would be helpful in the differentiaton of subpopulations in relation to hunting and management. This will be facilitated through the IUCN PBSG (Polar Bear Specialist Group) lead by Denmark as given in the resolutions from the last meeting in Seattle, June 2005. Beside this, a large Danish-Greenland research programme with numeours international scientific cooperation partners has been on-going since 1999, with several international published peer-reviewed papers. \n\nThe present study would follow up previous work by resampling the same polar bear subpopulations with the help of polar bear biologists and hunters in circumpolar countries, with extension to populations in the Russian Arctic. This proposed project will build on the network of interested scientists in Alaska (USA), Nunavut/Canada, Greenland/Denmark and Norway, as well as new Russian collaborators, that was established in 2000-2001. The proposed study would complement polar bear and ringed seal programs envisaged under IPY, or ongoing in each country, which are focussed, broadly speaking, on marine mammal ecology including polar bears. It would also link to human health and social integrity studies related to traditional diet and contaminants as well as climate changes. The project would use a common protocol for sample collection (timing, tissue type, preservation) and analysis. Chemical analysis would be done in 3-4 Canadian, Danish and Alascian labs (few specialised analyses might be done by a single specialized lab) while the pathological/micro pathogen analyses may be done at different national labs. Tissues would be archived for future chemical analyses. The contaminant results would be interpreted in terms of temporal trends (compared to previous studies on the same populations), spatial trends (especially of new contaminants) and potential for effects on polar bears and by extension to human exposure. In addition markers of climate changes will be developed, analysed and interpreted.",

            "definition": "The Arctic Social Indicators project (ASI) is a new project following up on the Arctic Human Development Report (AHDR). The ASI project seeks to devise indicators to facilitate the tracking and monitoring of human development in the Arctic, and is being developed under the auspices of the Sustainable Development Working Group (SDWG) of the Arctic Council. The project period is 2006-2008, with the final report being planned for late summer of 2008, and a presentation of results at the Sixth International Congress of Arctic Social Sciences (ICASS IV) in Nuuk, Greenland.\nThe project’s main objective is to devise a limited set of indicators that reflect key aspects of human development in the Arctic, that are tractable in terms of measurement, and that can be monitored over time at a reasonable cost in terms of labour and material resources. The goal is to weigh the relative merits of a range of proposed indicators of human development in the Arctic, to select a number of indicators that seem most likely to prove successful in this context, and to test indicators with existing data and in discussions with representatives from various Arctic communities. The project, which covers the developmental stage in a long-term effort to measure and monitor human development on an integrated basis in the circumpolar Arctic can benefit a wide range of stakeholders, including those involved in Arctic policy making processes, residents of the North, and those engaged in the Arctic social sciences.\nThe scope and significance of the AHDR report has been recognized and widely praised both among those concerned with Arctic affairs and among those who deal with human development in the world at large. It presents a broad overview of the state of human development or social well-being in the circumpolar Arctic as of the early years of the 21st century, and as such, provides a baseline or a starting point from which to measure changes over time in the state of human development. The development of a suite of indicators was a part of the original vision of those who articulated the rationale for the development of the AHDR, but there was neither the time nor the material resources needed to produce a high quality product of this type. Therefore, the AHDR does not present quantifiable indicators suitable for monitoring or tracking changes in human development in the Arctic. There remains, however, an obvious need for indicators of this sort, and this is where the ASI follow-up project will seek to fill a critical gap.\nWhen determining the usefulness of an indicator and deciding among a group of possible indicators we can look at whether the chosen indicators are generalizable and stable, easy to measure in a broadly accepted manner, and suitable for use in longitudinal analyses. Thus, the exercise of devising useful indicators is indeed a challenge. From this perspective, then, it is desirable to develop a small suite of indicators that capture the essential features of the phenomenon in question and can be measured empirically in a simple and intuitively appealing manner. The ASI working group has so far decided on six domains for the construction of social indicators, and team leaders have been assigned to each of these domains: (1) Fate control and or the ability to guide one’s own destiny; (2) Cultural integrity or belonging to a viable local culture; and (3) Contact with nature or interacting closely with the natural world. Three additional domains have been identified – namely, the domains used by the UNDP in constructing the Human Development Index: (4) Education; (5) Demography/Health; and (6) Material Well-being. The work on the construction of indicators for these six domains is now underway.\nThere will be a number of components to the project’s assessment strategy, which will include a consultation process and the testing of indicators using existing data and discussions with representatives from various Arctic communities. Community and indigenous feedback will be a critical part of the evaluation process.\nThe development of a report on Arctic Social Indicators will enable various stakeholders to evaluate trends that affect sustainable human development among residents of the Arctic over time. The ASI report will make it possible to compare and contrast conditions of human development throughout the Arctic. This will assist policymakers and the Arctic Council working groups to identify priorities. While the AHDR provided a baseline to human development in the Arctic, the proposed Arctic Social Indicator project will better enable the SDWG and policymakers at large to identify major changes relating to human development in the Arctic and hence provide a tool for measuring development, the effectiveness of policies and appropriateness of actions to address issues of human development.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=462",

Study geographic variation in infections, parasites, immune system functioning and pollution levels in birds.\n2. An effect study on individual marked birds\n3. Modelling future scenario's of geographic variation and relating the findings to climate change, nature management and human health.\n\nHealthy individuals are able to optimize resource use, survival and reproduction. Health of an individual will be under constant attack. Animals have developed immunological, physiological and behavioural strategies to battle these attacks from pathogens, parasites and/or pollution on their health. This battle for health is the main theme of the study. \n\nIndividually marked birds are the subject of this study. They can be studied over their life time in the wild. Health of marked individuals can be correlated with present and future fitness. Experimental manipulations will quantify the consequences of specific attacks on health and will determine cause and effect in the correlations.\n\nEcological immunology is a fast developing field, with beautiful examples of individual and species differences in immune response. Population size and distribution is structured by pathogens, parasites and pollution, which effect on fitness often is a complex interaction in an evolution of the struggle for survival. Spatial and temporal variation between populations and individuals is the main focus of the study.\n\nThe polar regions are of special interest for this study. These areas are considered to have relatively low levels of pathogens, parasites and pollution. Migratory birds linking temperate regions with the Arctic are potential vectors of diseases as shown by the recent spread of the West Nile Virus and Avian Influenza: diseases which are threatening domestic animals and humans. With a changing arctic due to climate change and pollution, more knowledge is needed on how animals cope with attacks on their health.\n\nIn the IPY, we will classify the occurrence of pathogens, antibodies, parasites and pollution levels in individually marked wild birds in the Arctic and Antarctic. We will study the immune system by running tests on blood samples or by challenging the individuals and monitor the production of antibodies. Fitness of the birds is measured during sampling as reproductive output or body condition, but also later as e.g. survival. Health can be monitored over time when the individual is repeatedly seen or caught. Finally we will model temporal and spatial variation and relate our findings to climate change, nature management and human health.",

During the past few decades, our understanding of deep continental margin habitats has changed more than for any other large area of Earth. While it has been known for a long time that the ocean margins are a mixture of rugged mountainous scenery and sediment- covered slopes, it is only in recent times, with higher-resolution bathymetry and increased bottom sampling, that areas once envisioned as monotonous landscapes are now acknowledged to have a high degree of complexity and diversity. Continental margins furthermore support some of the ocean's strongest gradients (e.g. depth, pressure, organic matter flux, oxygen). Collectively, these processes create unique ecosystems, which some are only now being discovered and which we are just beginning to understand. As exploitation of living and mineral resources is advancing faster than ecological knowledge on continental slopes, a comprehensive analysis of species distribution, biodiversity patterns and processes on continental margins is needed. \n\nAn objective of COMARGE is to turn basic advances in ecology into sound environmental advice. Fundamental patterns of species distribution first observed and explained in the context of monotonous slopes will be re-evaluated in light of the newly recognized heterogeneity of continental margins. Multi-scale habitat definition and mapping will provide basic georeferenced information to develop environmental sensitivity maps. Comprehensive cross-margin syntheses at the species level will enlighten benthic species distributions in the deep-sea realm and refine estimates of how many species co-exist on continental margins. The scale of species distribution is a matter of debate among deep-sea ecologists and a basic requirement in conservation policies. Comprehensive cross-margin syntheses at the community level will allow local to global testing of controls on species diversity, will generate data inputs for food web models and will provide insights in theoretical ecology. A better understanding of biodiversity patterns and processes, ecosystem functioning and their inter-relationships is acutely needed in order to forecast environmental risks on continental margins.\n\nSummary provided by http://www.ifremer.fr/comarge/en/index.html",

            "definition": "Antarctica is the primary heat sink in the global climate system, and plays an important role in climate change and variability. Projections of the state of global change (e.g., global warming, ozone depletion) must accurately account for Antarctic atmospheric processes whose effects are transmitted to the rest of the planet via the atmosphere and the ocean. In addition, the processes by which tropical latitudes impact Antarctic are not well understood.\n\nAs a means to improve our understanding of atmospheric processes and transports between Antarctica and lower latitudes, a basic and applied research program is proposed to explore these atmospheric processes in detail. AC Squared will consist of both observational and modeling components with the fundamental goals to study the physical processes associated with transports throughout atmospheric column from the near-surface layer to the lower stratosphere and examine modulation of those transports during episodes of extratropical cyclone forcing, to accurately simulate these processes within numerical models, and to understand the mechanisms that produce teleconnections from the tropics and Antarctica, especially the interaction between the Southern Annular Mode and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. As an additional benefit, AC Squared will advance short term to medium range weather forecasting in the high southern latitudes. It is believed that proper representation of Antarctic processes is prerequisite to accurate climate studies, especially since Antarctic transports are strongly tied to local topographic and mesoscale processes that are currently not resolved within GCMs. It is therefore necessary to understand local and regional processes before these effects can be assimilated into GCMs and global change issues can be considered. A series of objectives have been set for AC Squared that are deemed necessary before climate sensitivity issues can be addressed:\n\n• Objective 1: To better understand key phenomena such as boundary-layer dynamics, topographic modification of synoptic and mesoscale features, cloud-radiation interactions, and moist processes accompanying episodes of cyclonic activity over the Southern Ocean adjacent to Antarctica that are associated with interactions between Antarctica and lower latitudes.\n• Objective 2: To examine key processes associated with the dynamics and chemistry of the lower stratosphere including development of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), conduct field observations and in-situ measurements of chemical species and transports and modulation by large-scale dynamics processes.\n• Objective 3: To conduct detailed measurements of key physical processes in the boundary layer and free atmosphere to permit the development of accurate parameterization schemes for use within numerical models, leading to high quality simulations of the atmospheric interactions.\n• Objective 4: To investigate the nature of atmospheric teleconnections and their modulation of the atmospheric interactions between Antarctica and lower latitudes using numerical models, atmospheric reanalyses, and satellite observations\n\nObjectives 1 and 2 will rely primarily on observations from the state-of-the-art HIAPER research aircraft flown out of Punta Arenas, Chile and southern New Zealand. Studies will be concentrated over the Weddell and Ross Sea embayments and areas to the north in association with the Schwerdtfeger Air Stream (SAS) and the Ross Air Stream (RAS), respectively. Satellite observations show PSCs to form frequently in the Weddell Sea area and airborne measurements will be conducted in the lower stratosphere in support of studies of transport dynamics of key chemical species.\n\nObjective 3 will rely on a combination of airborne and ground-based measurements that will likely be concentrated in the Ross Sea vicinity. Attempts are being made to use fixed wing research aircraft such as the British Twin Otter or Twin Otters currently used in support of U.S operations for low-level measurements.\n\nObjective 4 has a strong climate component and objective 1 can be thought of as case studies of the phenomena studied over a much longer period by this objective.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=180",

ARIANNA intends on detecting Cherenkov light at radio frequencies with specialized antenna and using these detections to learn more about some of the big questions in ultra-high energy particle physics including probing the GZK cutoff as well as possibly aiding the understanding of ultra-high energy neutrino sources. \n\nARIANNA intends to answer, or at least help to answer, some pressing questions in high energy neutrino physics due to a variety of capabilities:\n\n- ARIANNA increases the sensitivity for the detection of GZK neutrinos by an order of magnitude over the state-of-the-art detectors currently under construction, such as ANITA. Simulations indicate that ARIANNA can observe ~ 40 events per 6 months of operation based on widely used predictions for the GZK neutrino flux by Engel, Steckel & Stanev.\n\n- ARIANNA can test alternative scenarios for GZK neutrino production. For example, models that assume that extragalactic cosmic rays are mixed elemental composition, or perhaps entirely iron nuclei, predict fluxes that may be as small as ~5% of the ESS predictions.\n\n- ARIANNA can survey the southern half the sky for point sources of high-energy neutrinos with unprecedented sensitivity. Preliminary reconstruction studies show that the neutrino direction be measured to a precision of 1 degree, and additional improvements in the reconstruction procedure are expected. These encouraging results show that good reconstruction can be achieved despite imprecise knowledge of the path of the signal.\n\n- ARIANNA can probe for physics beyond the standard model by measuring the neutrino cross-section at center of momentum energies of 100 TeV, a factor 10 larger than available at the LHC.",

The lack of information in the Canadian Arctic Ocean on fish species distributions, their densities and ability to respond to climate change has implications for the development of new marine fisheries and ensuring that the current subsistence fisheries are sustainable. AMBER is part of an international cluster i.e by ArcOD, which deals with Arctic biodiversity. Many of the existing fisheries in the Arctic are dependent on the productivity of near shore coastal or estuarine ecosystems. Anadromous Arctic char, for example, obtain most of their energy during the short Arctic summer while feeding in the marine (estuarial) environment. Nunavuts largest commercial fishery is dependent on the deep-water marine ecosystems of Baffin Bay and Davis Strait. Climate change models suggest that global warming will impact these ecosystems. AMBER will intensely study three Arctic Marine inshore environments, which support large subsistence Arctic Char fisheries, and the deep-water ecosystem of Nunavuts Greenland Turbot fishery. AMBER will improve our understanding of the ecology of Arctic marine ecosystems so the impacts of climate change can be better assessed and help provide the information needed to take an ecosystem approach to the management and development of the Arctic marine fisheries resource. Furthermore, there is a need for much better linkages between the physical changes occurring in the marine environment and biota, including fish behaviour and feeding patterns. AMBER proposes to work with researchers and companies developing new technologies to monitor changes in ocean currents, salinity and temperature in order to correlate with fish distributions and energy requirements. We will develop energy models for inshore/estuarine fisheries and correlate with climate change scenarios and alien species invasions. The energy models will have direct application to inshore estuarine fisheries throughout the Arctic. Knowledge gained from AMBER will help northern communities plan for the impacts of Arctic warming and improve management of Arctic fisheries. By focusing AMBER on ecosystems which support important subsistence and commercial fisheries, AMBER will be able to effectively engage community participation in the project. Both of AMBERs project leads have extensive experience working with Arctic communities.\nAMBER also proposes to study the inshore Arctic char fisheries associated with Iqaluit (Frobisher Bay, Nunavut), and Holman and Prince Albert Sound (Northwest Territories). The Iqaluit system represents a high tide estuarine marine environment; while Holman represents a near-shore marine environment influenced by ice melt. Both locations have community based fisheries management and monitoring programs that will be integrated into AMBER. The study of the Deep-water marine ecosystem associated with the Greenland turbot fishery will build on our current research underway in the Davis Strait, strengthen our international collaborations and expand the knowledge of Arctic marine food webs. AMBER will also increase the breadth and depth of knowledge on factors shaping Arctic marine biological communities by building new interdisciplinary synergies with the Early Warning System for Detecting Arctic Marine Ecosystem Change through the Use of Top Predators and Reconstructing the Surface of the Arctic Ocean Basin. As more is learned about the current distributions and densities of Arctic marine biota, an understanding of ocean currents and movements of fresh and saline waters, will undoubtedly be important in predicting future distributional patterns of biota.\nAMBER will directly engage northern communities by incorporating and expanding existing community fisheries monitoring projects. The knowledge and experience gained through AMBER will provide the baseline information required to set ecosystem objectives and reference levels for monitoring the health of these important ecosystems. By including three different systems in AMBER, models will be developed which will aid other communities in developing monitoring programs. The interactions at the community level will involve schools, colleges, northern research Institutes and the local Hunters and Trappers Associations and the development of inshore environmental monitoring and fisheries training. The legacy will be an educational/training knowledge base, which will include technical skills and decision-making capabilities, along with monitoring buoys, which will be an integral part of the Arctic communities contribution to global models on climate change.",

            "definition": "We propose an international collaboration to study hydrothermal venting on the ultra-slow spreading Arctic mid-ocean ridge system. The Gakkel Ridge is a key target for hydrothermal studies because it has distinctive geological characteristics as a result of ultra-slow spreading (full spreading rate of 3-7 mm/yr), and because it is hydrographically isolated from the rest of the world’s ocean basins, which has important implications for vent field biological communities. In addition, major portions of the Arctic mid-ocean ridge system lie in deep water (> 4000 m) under the ice pack, rendering them inaccessible to traditional deep submergence technologies. We are solving this problem by developing robotic vehicles that will be able to autonomously detect, localize, survey, and sample deep-sea vent fields under the Arctic ice pack. As a result, our project is technology intensive and involves a strong component of discovery while at sea, which, when combined with our scientific objectives produces a compelling project that is very much in line with the objectives and spirit of the International Polar Year.\nOur major scientific themes are the geological diversity and biogeography of hydrothermal vents on the Arctic mid-ocean ridge system. Our major technology theme is autonomous exploration and sample return with an explicit mandate to develop techniques and methods for eventual use in astrobiology missions to search for life under the ice covered oceans of Europa, a moon of Jupiter (through funding from the US NASA). Our plan is to stage a series of at least two expeditions to different portions of the Arctic mid-ocean ridge during the IPY period (2007-2008). A US-led expedition will target suspected hydrothermal vent sites under 'permanent' pack ice at 85E and 9E on the Gakkel Ridge, and a Norway-led expedition will target sites in seasonally ice-free water over the Mohns Ridge. The results of these two expeditions will be combined to reveal systematic patterns regarding biogeography (through both community-level and genetic-level investigations) of vent-endemic fauna, to study the differences between basalt vs. peridotite hosted vent fields, and to improve our understanding of hydrothermal circulation at ultra-slow spreading plate boundaries where amagmatic extension and long-lived faulting are the dominant mechanisms.\nThrough a combination of both traditional and novel instrumentation technologies we will conduct hydrographic surveys to constrain the size, shape, and composition of hydrothermal plumes in the water column above the vent fields. At the Mohns Ridge, the Norwegian led efforts will then proceed as usual for vent field studies in open water using an remotely operated vehicle (ROV). On the Gakkel Ridge the shape of the plume, and the location of the positively buoyant plume stem, in particular, will be used to localize the source vent fields to ≤ 100m, and this information will be used to guide autonomous surveys (with autonomous underwater vehicles - AUVs) to generate fine-scale microbathymetry maps and photomosaics of the vent fields. The photomosaic imagery will be used to identify immobile sampling targets, and an AUV equipped with a rudimentary manipulator/sampler will then be used to acquire immobile (e.g., sessile) samples. The PUMA and JAGUAR AUVs are presently under development at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for this mission, with a customized AUV-mounted manipulator being developed at the University of Maryland's Space Systems Laboratory. The AUVs will be tested under the Arctic ice pack in summer 2006 from the USCG Healy.\nAfter the expeditions samples and survey data will be disseminated to collaborating scientists at various institutions within our international consortium, such that a comprehensive suite of measurements and analyses will be conducted. Our formal effort will conclude with an international workshop to disseminate our results and focus future initiatives. Major funding for our proposed research is already in hand (see Section 3.10) through the US National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs (Arctic Natural Sciences section) and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In addition, the Norwegian-led effort to find and study vent fields on the Mohns Ridge has already gotten off to a fantastic start with the major discovery of new vent fields during the summer 2005 field season (http://195.37.14.189/public_html/sciencewriteratsea/Norway2005/web-content/Navigation/press/Norway.html). Scientists and engineers in Japan and Germany will contribute to the project by providing key personnel and equipment for the various Arctic expeditions, and by collaborating in post-cruise analyses of survey and sample data.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=173",

The processes leading to a calving event include the initiation and propagation of through-cutting rifts. Iceberg calving can result in a significant loss of mass from the Antarctic ice sheet, and represents ~ 65% of the total ice sheet ablation. Therefore, it is critical to understand the processes which precede and lead up to a major calving event in order to realistically assess how future climate changes might affect the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Post-calving, iceberg drift is influenced by the shape of the coastline, bottom topography, and a combination of tides, currents, wind, and sea ice. Monitoring the evolution of icebergs as they drift into warmer waters provides a valuable experiment in how rapid climate change influences ice shelves - especially such components as firn compaction, the impact of surface meltwater, ponding, and iceberg break-up. Grounded icebergs cause a severe devastation of the sea floor, forcing benthic communities to re-colonise. Iceberg melting and decay represents a significant source of freshwater (and mineral dust) primarily into the upper layers of the Southern Ocean's northern fringe. A stabilisation of the weakly stratified water column has important and poorly understood consequences for sea ice and water masses involved in deep and bottom water formation, and the biology of the euphotic zone. \n\nCRAC-ICE's first objective is to develop an understanding of the mechanics of ice shelf rift initiation and propagation via three complementary components:\n1. Fieldwork: Networks of autonomous observation stations (GPS, seismometers, webcams and AWS) will be deployed around selected rift tips on each ice shelf for one year. The measurements will be combined with oceanographic measurements of currents, temperature and salinity, and significant wave heights. These mirror campaigns will provide a continuous time series of rift widening (GPS) as well as rupture locations and source mechanisms (seismic), which can be compared with environmental effects such as large storms. Ground penetrating radar profiles will be collected, to probe the subsurface structure of the rift. Cores will be taken of the mélange inside each rift to determine its composition. On the Ross Ice Shelf, autonomous vertical profilers will be installed beneath a rift to monitor ocean currents and mixing, and to take depth profiles of salinity and temperature on a daily basis for one year. \n2. Satellite data analysis: Satellite images (e.g. MODIS, MISR, ASTER, RADARSAT) provide 'snapshot' observations of the surface expression of the rift at discrete time intervals. Image pairs provide estimates of velocity, ice strain rates, and rift widening rates on much larger spatial and temporal scales than the ground-based measurements. InSAR analysis using Radarsat will provide rift deformation rates. ICESat/CryoSat laser and radar altimeter data will be used to provide surface profile information for each rift and estimate mélange thickness.\n3. Modeling: Physical modelling, using a large ice tank, will be used to simulate ice shelf behaviour over a range of conditions. The results from these experiments, along with data collected in (1) and (2), will be used to construct realistic suites of numerical models of ice shelves which explicitly include fracture physics. This will enable careful hypothesis testing of the mechanisms and processes which occur during ice shelf break up - including the effect of mélange within rifts.\n\nCRAC-ICE's second objective is the monitoring of iceberg evolution as they drift away from their calving sites, based on:\n1. Shipbased observations near drifting bergs, including the deployment of autonomous observation stations on icebergs of various sizes equipped with sensors for position, air pressure, strain and tilt, reporting via the ARGOS system.\n2. Satellite data analysis using imagery (e.g. Envisat, Radarsat, ALOS) with different spatial resolution. A pattern-recognition algorithm will be applied to identify and track icebergs with minimum lengths between 200 - 500 m (depending on pixel size). Radar imagery will be used to monitor the physical changes in icebergs (surface melting, firn compaction, ponding, etc.) from their sites of calving through to their final break-up. Estimates of the total mass loss (and related freshwater flux) will be made by combining size information from satellite imagery with freeboard elevation from satellite altimetry (ICESat, CryoSat, Envisat), both compared with modeled melt rates. \n3. Modeling of iceberg drift to guide image acquisition. The simulated track will be used to bridge the interval between a pair of images. Modeled side wall (including wave erosion) and basal melting will be used to verify the observed mass losses due to size and freeboard reductions.",

The purpose of\nthis five week long campaign was to conduct a series of instrumented\nflights to measure the interaction of solar energy with clear and\ncloudy skies to provide additional insight into recent observations of\nenhanced absorption in cloudy atmospheres.As such, ARESE focused on\ntwo scientific objectives: (1) the direct measurement of the\nabsorption of solar radiation by clear and cloudy atmospheres and the\nplacement of bounds on these measurements; and\n\n(2) the investigation of the possible causes of absorption in excess\n    of the model predictions.\n\nTo accomplish these objectives, ARESE used a combination of satellite,\n  aircraft, and ground observations to make highly accurate solar flux\n  measurements at different altitudes throughout the atmospheric\n  column. At the heart of this was a carefully 'stacked' Twin Otter\n  and Egrett 'cloud sandwich' with the Otter at 1500 - 5000 ft and the\n  Egrett at 43,000 ft. This was overflown by an ER-2 flying at 65,000\n  ft, which because of its much higher speed did not stay in constant\n  alignment with the Twin Otter/Egrett stack but did provide periodic\n  coincidences with these other aircraft. All three aircraft carried\n  identical up- and down-looking 'Valero' radiometers and flew over\n  identical up-looking radiometers at the CART central and extended\n  facilities. Radiance measurements from the GOES satellites were used\n  to retrieve top-of-the atmosphere fluxes. These flux measurements\n  were supplemented by a variety of cloud property measurements from\n  the ground, the Egrett and the ER-2, including!  radar, lidar and\n  multispectral measurements.\n\nThese baseline ARESE flights were conducted at the CART site from\nSeptember 25 through November 1. During that time we flew twelve\nscientific data flights and accumulated approximately 60 hours of\nin-flight data under a variety of atmospheric conditions ranging from\nclear to solid overcast. These flights are detailed in the table below\nand include: cloud forcing experiments under scattered, broken, and\nsolid overcast conditions including low, mid-, and high-level cloud\ndecks; clear sky column absorption and surface albedo measurements;\nclear sky flux profiling measurements; and in-flight, co- altitude\nintercomparisons of flux measurements made from the two aircraft. The\ndata appear to be of excellent quality and comprise a unique data set\nfor testing our understanding of the absorption of solar radiation in\nboth clear and cloudy atmospheres.\n\nIn addition to these baseline solar absorption experiments, the ER-2\nalso performed some key calibration experiments. These used highly\naccurate spectral radiance measurements from the MODIS Airborne\nSimulator (MAS) to calibrate radiance measurements from the GOES\nsatellite and to improve retrieval algorithms for converting spectral\nradiances to spectral fluxes.\n\nThe success of this deployment was the result of the tremendous\nefforts of a multi-laboratory multiagency team comprised of five DOE\nLaboratories, three NASA Centers, about a dozen universities and three\naircraft companies. The ARM Program sponsored the ground-based\nmeasurements, ARM-UAV (Unmanned Aerospace Vehicle) the coordinated\nEgrett and Otter measurements, and ARM and NASA the ER-2\nflights. Funding was provided through the DOE's ARM Program and\nthrough DoD's Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program\n(SERDP).\n\nFor more information, link to\n'http://www.arm.gov/docs/iops/arese/AR_summ.html'",

Due to technical, environmental, and regulatory\ncomplications, these officials have grappled with this important\nissue, often coming up short of a workable, consistent plan for water\nresource management. Recently, scientific literature has shown that\nthe amount of impervious surface in a watershed proves to be a useful,\neasily identifiable indicator of overall water quality. In response to\nthis finding, the Towson University Center for Geographic Information\nSciences (CGIS) and its partners--the Towson University Department of\nGeography and Environmental Planning, the Maryland Space Grant\nConsortium, the Washington College Center for the Environment and\nSociety, and the Maryland Virtual High School--completeda project to\nmap impervious cover for the entire Chesapeake Bay and Maryland\nCoastal Bays watersheds. The goal of this project is to supply state\nand local official with the impervious surface data and with the\ntechnical and theoretical background they need to integrate\nimperviousness into their water quality protection measures.\n\nTo complete the impervious surface mapping project, CGIS used remote\nsensing and geographic information system (GIS) technologies to\nidentify pervious and impervious land cover types throughout the\nChesapeake Bay and Maryland Coastal Bays watersheds. The data was then\n'clipped' by watershed and county boundaries tomake the information as\nuseful as possible to its intended audience--state and local\ngovernment officials. This data was then uploaded onto a CGIS server\nto be distributed to its end users via an online Infomart, complete\nwith raw remotely sensed data (Landsat 7 EMT+), geospatial data, and\nbackground information onremote sensing/digital image\nprocessing. Additionally, the Infomart contains a link for K-12\nteachers, which includes lesson plans on imperviousness that teachers\ncan use within their classrooms. K-12 teachers and their students have\nalready played an integral role in the impervious surface project by\nground truthing over 15,000 land-cover points, using portable GPS\nunits supplied to them by CGIS. Finally, the Infomart serves as the\nfocus of a Project NEMO (Non-Point Education of Municipal Officials),\nuniversity-based outreach program to educategovernment officials on\nwatershed ecology, imperviousness, and potential mitigation measures.\n\nFor more information, link to 'http://chesapeake.towson.edu/'",

Rapid regional warming of air temperatures observed over the last fifty years has been exceptional and unprecedented within the past 500 years.  As a consequence, glaciers are retreating and leaving new ice-free areas for primary colonization of terrestrial and near shore marine plants and animals.\n\nThe ClicOPEN initiative is aimed at investigating the response of terrestrial and marine coastal systems to ongoing climate change along this area.  The project is land based and uses existing Antarctic research stations in four different areas of the Antarctic Peninsula as platforms for synoptic field and laboratory studies during the IPY. It will start during the Antarctic summer of 2006/2007.\n\nThe objectives within the ClicOPEN approach are dual:\nA) to analyze and quantify effects of glacial melting and increased rock erosion on terrestrial and near shore marine ecosystems on a latitudinal gradient along the Western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. \nB) to provide a basis for a mechanistic understanding of climate change processes at the peninsula that will serve to draw a link to present and future changes in more remote shelf regions of the Southern Ocean. \n\nClicOPEN is land based and uses existing Antarctic research stations in 4 different areas of the Antarctic Peninsula as platforms for synoptic field and laboratory studies during the IPY.

Breach of this stability affects societies and economic activity in high latitudes. Currently, changes in terrestrial cryosphere are among the strongest contemporary environmental changes. However, these changes as well as their associated feedbacks and impacts are still inadequately described within the contemporary Earth System Models. During the 20th century, we observed snow cover and glaciers' retreat and permafrost thaw affecting water supply, land cover, and the carbon cycle. Glacier wastage has affected sea level rise, water freshening, sea ice reduction, bioproductivity changing, and redistributing gravity field patterns. Further consequences are difficult to predict. Paleodata, instrumental observations, and model simulations of future climate changes suggest significant and rapid changes in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and land cover occur in high latitudes particularly over the CLR. It is critical to develop the ability to measure, monitor, and model the processes that will provide the possibility for accurate future projections of climatic and environmental changes in these regions because these changes have the potential to impact the Global Earth System and human society. We need (a) to understand how the changes in these regions affect regional and global biogeochemical, surface energy and water cycles, as well as human societies and how to develop the capability to predict changes to support global projections, informed decision making, and numerous applications in these regions; (b) to establish (restore, develop, utilize) an observational system to retrieve and properly interpret information about the current state and changes of the environment in the CLR; (c) assess their interactions with global climate and society; and (d) enhance the predictive capability of Earth System models to account for environmental changes over the Northern Hemisphere and the globe.\n\nThe overarching science question of this IPY activity is: How do terrestrial cryosphere dynamics in the Northern Hemisphere interact with and alter the biosphere, atmosphere, cryosphere, and hydrosphere of the Earth? \nThe Science question dictates the following research strategy: We have to define first (a) what deficiencies currently exist in understanding the major processes in cold land regions? (b) what are the major sources of uncertainties? (c) what information is needed to run (and/or develop) sufficiently complete models that describe these processes? Thereafter, targeted field campaigns, data gathering /recovery, and/or new networks should be initiated. \n\nWithin the triad: observations, process studies, and modeling, the role of Process Studies in Cold Land Regions is to improve models that reproduce the changes in the Earth System behavior in response to the changes in high latitudes. Currently existing models do not describe sufficiently well the critical processes of interactions and their dynamics within terrestrial ecosystems, atmosphere, hydrosphere, coastal zone, and cryosphere in CLR. Also, the initial state of some of components of the Earth System in the Regions (e.g., the cryosphere) is not yet well known. We need to justify both the innovative research and efforts to improve observations in the region that otherwise could be ineffective investments in old technology and practices. \n\nThree terrestrial components of the cryosphere in the CLR of the Northern Hemisphere: snow cover, permafrost, and small glaciers will be studied as well as their interactions with society and potential feedbacks to the Global Earth System. Within each area of research the foci of studies will be on (a) the models' development to improve understanding and projections of the dynamics of the Earth System in high latitudes and its interactions with the Global Earth System and (b) creation of conditions for seamless implementation of these models (e.g., organizing the input data stream for them) in a quest of answering the overarching science question and serving numerous practical applications. \n\nTasks for snow cover studies. Major issues: (a) Global Earth System modeling and numerous applications require high resolution global snow water equivalent measurements, their extension in the past, and a proper physical description of processes describing snow dynamics; (b) Having a new Cold Land Processes Mission (CLPM) as a long-term objective, the IPY is the right time for extensive and focused groundwork to secure the Mission success. Tools: (a) Extensive field campaigns and network legacy to guaranty the CLPM calibration and ongoing support over the Hemisphere; (b) Studies of compatibility of various (in-situ and remote) instrumentation and data rescue efforts; (c) Development of a portable (scalable) physically based model of short-term and seasonal snow evolution applicable to rough terrain and/or in the presence of vegetation.\n\nTasks for permafrost studies. Major issue: Permafrost changes (warming and thawing) have global consequences these processes should be well understood, monitored, modeled, and projected. Mitigation strategies should be timely developed. Tools: (a) Establish and support a comprehensive permafrost monitoring system in the high latitudes including the Arctic coastal zone; (b) Develop reliable models accounting for changes in the permafrost and its interactions with terrestrial ecosystems, hydrology, atmosphere, and society and incorporate them into emerging global Earth System and reanalyses models; (c) Develop specialty models that seamlessly account for specifics of permafrost environment in practical applications (coastal erosion, cold land engineering, etc.) \n\nTasks for glaciers' studies. Major issues: Increase in accuracy of monitoring of glaciers' dynamics from space and in situ observations to resolve the major uncertainties of the global glaciers' changes, first of all surface area and distribution versus elevation and surface mass balance with extrapolation from the observational network to the larger glacier systems. Tools: (a) Develop a conceptual model for areal generalization of the glaciers' characteristics and their monitoring; (b) Develop a portable model that describes the processes of glaciers' change in response to climate change; the model should be useable as a block in the regional and global climate models as well as for water and natural hazard management; (c) Repeat regular monitoring using laser altimetry for glaciers in CLR and blending these observations with existing long-term observational network data; (d) Assessment of direct anthropogenic impact on glaciers' dynamics (e.g., due to air pollution). Mostly small glaciers of the Northern Hemisphere will be studied within this IPY proposal.\n\nTasks for socio-economic studies. Major issue: Fragile environment and harsh climatic conditions in high latitudes put additional stress on societal sustainability during rapid environmental changes. Tools: (a) Determine the impacts of environmental changes in high latitudes on humans in particular on the indigenous population; (b) Develop models of economic effect, both positive and negative, of the ongoing and possible climate changes, snow- glaciers- and permafrost-related hazards; (c) Develop the societal feedback loop models for use in Global Earth models; (d) Develop mitigation strategies for the populations negatively affected by contemporary and projected environmental changes.\n\nTasks for integration studies. Major issue: Need for suite of regional models that incorporate peculiarities of interactions of climate, cryosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere of high latitudes and serve as a reliable internal block to Global Earth Models. Tools: (a) Develop regional models (e.g., reanalysis, WRF, LDAS) with specialty blocks (hydrology, cold land, coastal processes, ecosystem, societal interactions) incorporating major feedbacks that are specific for high latitudinal land areas and are of global importance (e.g., potentially powerful permafrost thawing over CLR and the Arctic coastal zone and greenhouse gases emission positive feedback); (b) Develop (improve) regional numerical weather forecast models to account for specifics of the high latitudes (including specific societal needs); (c) Verify Global Climate Models' projections in the high latitudes; (d) Organize input data stream (remote and in-situ) sufficient for operating the system that can answer the overarching science question and serve numerous practical applications.",

The original EOI for a single line of acoustic receivers through the narrowest channels in the Canadian Archipelago drew interest from marine mammal trackers and ocean observers from the Bering Strait to Norway. So, ASTAPA now includes multiple lines to record direction and speed of travel as well as local oceanographics at key passages. ASTAPA would have the proven data gathering and management capacity of the operational Census of Marine Life (COML) Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) project (www.postcoml.org) to tag animals as small as 20g with individually unique acoustic codes and to follow larger tags for up to 20 years.\nThe Arctic is a more challenging environment, but the POST personnel with technical experience will work with DFO colleagues to develop the logistics for putting the system in place. A consortium would be developed to maintain receiver lines. VR3 receivers, produced by Canadian manufacturer, VEMCO-AMIRIX, allow frequent data recovery for up to seven years simply by putting a hydrophone modem connection in the water. In the Arctic this can be done throughout the winter through an ice hole, and in summer from small boats. Individual receivers record the presence of a tag within a kilometer, so tagged animal movements in open water or under ice can be tracked. Also, VR3s have sensors to measure, store and download physical data via modem, so there is strong synergy and potential savings between physics and biology. As with POST, most tagging would be done by other researchers and consortia. We have identified a broad range of projects interested in the data ASTAPA can return. There are two ways that ASTAPA complements the many projects tagging animals with satellite tags: (1) acoustic tags implanted at the same time provide a unique identifier for up to 20 years, so that changes in individual animal behaviour can be correlated with climate change and (2) data recovery is controlled locally by local people and does not depend on remote multi-billion dollar satellite networks. Planned future developments will add download capacity to VR3 receivers so that data stored in archival tags can be transferred acoustically to receivers instead of by radio to satellites, greatly reducing data costs. \nASTAPA complements several of the other IPY EOIs. For example EOI 624 AMBER examines fish distributions, density and reaction to climate change. Much of the field work for this project will be centered in the waterways around Resolute. ASTAPA proposes the installation of an acoustic curtain in this area. The logistical crossover between the two projects will be high. Also, our monitoring of animal movement and the characteristics of the water column will complement AMBER, just as their information of fish fauna composition, density and distribution will complement ASTAPA. Also, EOI 713 Canadian Arctic CoML will provide information on biodiversity that will be valuable in completing the picture of multi species interactions that we observe by animal tracking. Logistical cross-over includes at the least ship time on the CCGS Amundsen. EOI's 663 GWAMM, 77 and 153 MEOP will provide information on the physical attributes of the water column profiled by tagged marine mammals, including information from areas under ice. We will also have similar information. Ship gathered CTD's by these projects will also increase our knowledge of physical variables of the water column as our static lines provide the same information at key points. Also, logistics of equipment movement and animal tagging can be coordinated to reduce effort and cost and maximize results. EOI's 688 COME and 673 Canadian Icebreaker provide transport to remote locations for installation and downloading of acoustic curtain data. While EOI's 682 Freshwater Flux in Canadian Arctic, 80 and 14 IAOOS will provide much needed information on the movement and characteristics of waters throughout the Arctic Archipelago.",

The geology of the seafloor along the coast and continental shelf of Southern California provides diverse habitats that include rich fisheries, kelp forests, marine mammals, and many other niches and biological guilds. Both human and non-human inhabitants are at risk from pollution of the coastal ocean and from the degradation of fresh-water sources as a result of salt-water intrusion. In addition, the coastal ocean is a resource for economic development (shipping), communication (trans-oceanic cables), fishing, recreation, and tourism. The CABRILLO project provides USGS scientists with an interdisciplinary framework in which these complex coastal issues can be studied.\n\nCABRILLO efforts currently focus on six component tasks and a regional synthesis:\n\n    * CASA - Salt Water Intrusion investigates offshore-onshore components of salt-water intrusion into coastal aquifers by developing 2D and 3D stratigraphic models of potential salt-water infiltration.\n    * Océano - Contaminant Processes studies ocean contaminants, their distribution along the coastal region and the processes by which they are transported.\n    * Playa - Coastal Change addresses issues of coastal change, including beach loss, shoreline retreat, and the processes that impact coastal stability.\n    * Tierra - Geologic Hazards investigates geologic hazards associated with submarine landslides, earthquakes, and tsunamis.\n    * Vida - Benthic Habitats concerns the relationship between sea-floor rock and sediment and benthic habitats.\n    * Región - Regional Synthesis provides a regional synthesis of Southern California's coastal and marine geology, the impact of man on the environment and the impact of the natural environment on man. \n\nSummary provided by http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/cabrillo/",

Specially instrumented NASA ER-2 and DC-8 aircraft were used to acquire a database on the chemical, meteorological and cloud-physical parameters associated with the phenomenon. The aircraft experiments were coupled with data from three separate satellite systems and ground based sensors located in various places on Antarctica. The collection of data from all experiments was the result of international collaboration and represents the most massive data acquisition ever performed over the Antarctic region.\n      \nThe instrumentation used to acquire the airborne data was developed under long-standing programs funded by the Upper Atmospheric Research and Tropospheric Chemistry offices of NASA's Earth Science and Applications Division. Results of the mission were presented at a Polar Ozone Symposium in Snowmass, Colorado in May of 1988. A two volume special issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research devoted to this experimental effort was published in August and November of 1989. The data obtained during the Antarctic mission show the lowest ozone levels ever recorded and directly implicate man-made chemical compounds, chlorofluorocarbons, in the enormous ozone loss over this remote region in the southern hemisphere.\n      \nOne of the most compelling pieces of evidence leading to this conclusion is shown in the chart . These data, measured on the ER-2 aircraft as it flew south from Chile into the ozone hole, show the dramatic inverse correlation between ozone and chlorine monoxide. Because chlorine monoxide is produced by the process in which manmade chlorine destroys ozone, the large quantities observed provide strong evidence that manmade chemicals are involved in the Antarctic ozone loss process.\n      \nRESEARCH SITE: Antarctica\n      \nCOLLABORATORS: NASA Goddard, NASA Langley, Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory, NOAA Aeronomy Lab, National Center for\nAtmospheric Research, AER Inc., Harvard University,\nUniversity of Denver, University of Washington,\nU.K. Meteo-rological Office, the European Center for\nMedium Range Forecasting, and CNRM.\n      \nFor more information, link to:\nhttp://cloud1.arc.nasa.gov/aaoe/",

The overarching goal of the SBI project is to understand the physical and biogeochemical processes that link the Arctic shelves, slopes, and deep basins. Relevant to this proposal, the SBI project will focus on a) biogeochemical modifications of Pacific water over the Beaufort and Chukchi shelf and slope regions, with emphasis on carbon and nitrogen; and b) comparative analysis of the findings over the broad Chukchi shelf and narrow Beaufort shelf and adjacent slopes to facilitate integration of the Western Arctic into a Pan-Arctic perspective. We will support the goals of SBI by evaluating the processes of carbon and nitrogen transport, exchanges and transformations in the regions of interest. Our specific interests will be: a) determination of mass transport and fate of carbon and nitrogen associated with the volume transports calculated by SBI collaborators; b) interpretation of carbon and nitrogen spatial distributions and temporal variability relative to biological and physical conditions; c) evaluation of partitioning of organic matter between dissolved and particulate phases; d) determination of net community production and its fate as DOM, suspended POM, and sinking POM; e) determination of C:N stoichiometry as a complement to biological studies, particularly in relation to community structure and seasonal progression of intense phytoplankton blooms in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas; and f) evaluation of the contribution of DOM vs. POM to apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) development in the Arctic halocline and export from the shelf.

It is inseparable from the polar freshwater system, both on land, ice and in the sea. Understanding the state of the cryosphere, and its associated past, present and future variability and change in time and space, is essential to understanding the polar environment in terms of its physical and biogeochemical interactions with the ocean, atmosphere and terrestrial systems, and the impacts on and interactions with social, cultural and economic systems. \nThis project is proposed and supported by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Climate and Cryosphere (CliC) project to provide a framework for assessing the polar cryospheric system and the related physical and chemical processes, interactions and impacts within the Earth system. The IPY provides the opportunity for a coordinated circumpolar assessment of both polar regions by nations and their organizations, scientists, and residents that likely would not be otherwise undertaken.\n\nThe 'State and Fate of the Polar Cryosphere' will establish links with the main projects (clusters) involved in monitoring, assessing, and understanding the variability, uncertainty, and change in the global cryosphere. This includes projects that will study permafrost, glaciers and ice sheets, sea ice, snow cover, and precipitation, as well as those involved in developing observing systems and data and information systems. We are also linking with projects involved in socioeconomic and cultural issues and those that will provide education and outreach, including traditional knowledge. (See section 4.2 for a complete list of participants.) The project will play a leadership, management, and coordinating role in the development of a sustained long-term cryospheric polar observing system, which would be implemented in the future through GCOS, GOOS, GTOS, CEOS, and possibly GEOSS. \n\nWe propose to coordinate activities and synthesize results to: \n1. assess the current state of cryospheric parameters in the high latitude regions, providing a snapshot of the cryosphere and an evaluation of its current (IPY) state in the context of past states and projections of the future;\n2. formulate the observational requirements of cryospheric variables for weather and climate monitoring and prediction and for other environmental assessments;\n3. strengthen international cooperation in the development of cryospheric observing systems.\n\nThe CliC International Project Office will support the coordination, and the CliC Data and Information System (DISC, http://clic.npolar.no/disc/) will provide the portal on the current state of the global cryosphere.\n\nThe 'State and Fate of the Polar Cryosphere' project will complement the newly developed Cryosphere Theme for the Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS), which is being developed jointly by CliC and SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) (http://stratus.ssec.wisc.edu/IGOS-cryo).\n\nThis project will also develop links to a number of diverse projects and activities that are examining the effects of a changing cryosphere on biological and human systems, e.g., the implications of changing polar snow cover characteristics on bird and mammal breeding. The aim is to document not only the changes that are happening to the global cryosphere, but to also highlight the diverse impacts of these changes.",

The experiment involved three U.S. Department of Energy laboratories, one National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration laboratory, and several universities. The experiment was conducted in a region of severe contrasts in adjacent surface types that accentuated the response of the atmosphere to variable surface forcing. Large values of sensible-heat flux and low values of latent-heat flux characterized a sagebrush steppe area; significantly smaller sen- sible-heat fluxes and much larger latent-heat fluxes were associated with extensive tracts of irrigated farmland to the north, east, and west of the steppe. Data were obtained from an array of surface flux stations, remote-sensing devices, an instrumented aircraft, and soil and vegetation measurements. The data will be used to address the problem of extrapolating from a limited number of local measurements to area-averaged values of fluxes suitable for use in global climate models. \n\nSummary provided by http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992BAMS...73.1785D",

Its objective is to study the evolution of life in Antarctic waters, to determine how this has influenced the diversity of the present biota, and to use these observations to predict how it might respond to future change. The CAML will collaborate with biological oceanographers in its work, for at its heart lies the integrated nature of ecological and biological change.\n\nPolar regions experience greater rates of climate change than elsewhere on the planet. The fauna of the regions are uniquely adapted to the extreme environments in which they exist, and may be vulnerable to shifts in climate. There is an urgent need to establish the state of these communities, and in particular their biodiversity, if we are to understand the impact of climate change. The project will integrate knowledge across all regions, biomes, habitats and fields of study to strengthen our knowledge of ecosystem dynamics in this high latitude, frozen ocean system. Only through a multi-scale level of investigation will a better understanding of the diversity and status of Antarctica's marine life be obtained.\n\nThe CAML's main biodiversity data will be collected from 17 research vessels during the IPY. In addition, tourist vessels will contribute observations and other ships will collect samples using the Continuous Plankton Recorder. The biodiversity data, collected as georeferenced species records, will available on the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research's Marine Biodiversity Information Network (SCAR-MarBIN http://www.scarmarbin.be) for researchers, governments and others concerned with ocean management.\n\nThe CAML will leave legacy sites for future comparability studies. It will employ modern genomic techniques and contribute to the Barcode of Life project, integrating with other Census projects. In particular, the CAML will interact very strongly with the Arctic Ocean Diversity Project (ArcOD), drawing comparisons between differences in ecological structure and dynamics between the Arctic and Southern Oceans.",

            "definition": "Climate change is already dramatically affecting the biosphere, but its effects on biological communities are still poorly understood. Because of the sensitivity of sea ice extent to temperature fluctuation, and the sensitivity of high-latitude species to changes in ice extent, the Southern Ocean represents a natural laboratory in which to investigate the impacts of global and regional climate change and any consequent biotic modifications. In the Southern Ocean, individual species depending on their link to sea ice may be affected independently, or there may be changes due to complex, multispecies interactions, e.g. bottom-up cascades from plankton to krill, fish and top-predators; conversely, top-down cascades could result from alterations of predation pressure as changing sea ice affects the degree of access of top predators to their prey. In this context, it is now well documented that, among air-breathing top-predators, variations in penguin population can be used as an indicator of climatic changes. The census of penguin populations over several decades and all around the continent has indeed revealed general long-term trends, some of which appear to be contradictory depending on spatial scale. For example, the West Antarctic Peninsula show trends that differ from those observed in the Ross Sea and elsewhere. Furthermore, colonies at the regional scale, such as the South Orkney Islands, can also show contrasting population trajectories. It has been found that small colonies respond more dramatically to the altered environment than larger ones, a response affected by the proximity of neighbouring colonies and their respective size. In other words, some of the fundamental mechanisms driving the dynamics of penguin populations still remain largely unidentified. A long-term monitoring of individual birds using methods that minimize disturbance is therefore necessary to determine the life-history parameters that respond to climate change, such as survival, emigration, breeding performance and foraging success as well as metapopulation dynamics (clusters of colonies). It is also critical to ascertain that the differences within and between colonies are not due to an experimental bias. A co-ordinated effort, therefore, is required in the monitoring and analysis at different sites, both in following individuals over the complete breeding season and in tracking them at sea where they feed The main goal of this project is precisely to address these issues. This will be carried out in the context of other IPY projects that have related objectives and in the context of existing long-term monitoring programmes that are already well established. These include the Census of Antarctic Marine Life (CAML) IPY EoI 83, Integrated Analyses of Circumpolar Climate Interactions and Ecosystem Dynamics in the Southern Ocean (ICED) IPY 417, and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). We propose:\n\n1. To define and use a population monitoring protocol for land-based top-predators that allows us to obtain large, quantitative sample sizes of year-round biological information about their breeding performance and at-sea activity and distribution with minimum disturbance for the population studied. This challenging task is feasible because of the major advances in microelectronics that have occurred over recent years. Our project will combine state-of-art electronic identification of individuals with the most-advanced bio-logging approaches. To minimize disturbance, the identification of animals requires that individuals are tagged with miniature passive implanted transponder microchips that are detected by radio receiver antennae (Automatic Identification System, AIS). This will be complemented by the bio-logging approach, which is based on externally-attached, miniature data-recorders that monitor the location, time-budget and/or feeding activity of free ranging animals.\n2. To co-ordinate and standardize the monitoring and analysis procedures used by different research groups so as to provide a circumpolar network of information on the status of penguin populations, an activity to further the goals of CCAMLR. This will include promoting the development of automatic systems to monitor penguin populations at sites not yet monitored and to provide assistance to research groups that do not yet have the expertise or resources in this domain.\n3. To share information on the population dynamics of penguins in relation to environmental variability (especially sea-ice) with: a) lead IPY projects (e.g. CAML EoI 83 and ICED EoI 417); b) other research groups investigating biological variability at other levels in the food chain (e.g. fish IPY EoI 248); and with d) a wider audience through media links and through internet-related links, including e) graduate and undergraduate students whose majors are related to Antarctic topics (e.g. through courses and lectures given at the International Antarctic Institute: http://www.iai.utas.edu.au/).\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=251",

            "definition": "Rationale: The stability of the ecosystems in more than a half of Northern Eurasia and north North America (in Cold Land Regions, CLR) relies on the stability of seasonal snow cover and ice that, so far, holds these ecosystems together. Breach of this stability affects societies and economic activity in high latitudes. Currently, changes in terrestrial cryosphere are among the strongest contemporary environmental changes. However, these changes as well as their associated feedbacks and impacts are still inadequately described within the contemporary Earth System Models. During the 20th century, we observed snow cover and glaciers’ retreat and permafrost thaw affecting water supply, land cover, and the carbon cycle. Glacier wastage has affected sea level rise, water freshening, sea ice reduction, bioproductivity changing, and redistributing gravity field patterns. Further consequences are difficult to predict. Paleodata, instrumental observations, and model simulations of future climate changes suggest significant and rapid changes in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and land cover occur in high latitudes particularly over the CLR. It is critical to develop the ability to measure, monitor, and model the processes that will provide the possibility for accurate future projections of climatic and environmental changes in these regions because these changes have the potential to impact the Global Earth System and human society. We need (a) to understand how the changes in these regions affect regional and global biogeochemical, surface energy and water cycles, as well as human societies and how to develop the capability to predict changes to support global projections, informed decision making, and numerous applications in these regions; (b) to establish (restore, develop, utilize) an observational system to retrieve and properly interpret information about the current state and changes of the environment in the CLR; (c) assess their interactions with global climate and society; and (d) enhance the predictive capability of Earth System models to account for environmental changes over the Northern Hemisphere and the globe.\n\nThe overarching science question of this IPY activity is: How do terrestrial cryosphere dynamics in the Northern Hemisphere interact with and alter the biosphere, atmosphere, cryosphere, and hydrosphere of the Earth?\nThe Science question dictates the following research strategy: We have to define first (a) what deficiencies currently exist in understanding the major processes in cold land regions? (b) what are the major sources of uncertainties? (c) what information is needed to run (and/or develop) sufficiently complete models that describe these processes? Thereafter, targeted field campaigns, data gathering /recovery, and/or new networks should be initiated.\n\nWithin the triad: observations, process studies, and modeling, the role of Process Studies in Cold Land Regions is to improve models that reproduce the changes in the Earth System behavior in response to the changes in high latitudes. Currently existing models do not describe sufficiently well the critical processes of interactions and their dynamics within terrestrial ecosystems, atmosphere, hydrosphere, coastal zone, and cryosphere in CLR. Also, the initial state of some of components of the Earth System in the Regions (e.g., the cryosphere) is not yet well known. We need to justify both the innovative research and efforts to improve observations in the region that otherwise could be ineffective investments in old technology and practices.\n\nThree terrestrial components of the cryosphere in the CLR of the Northern Hemisphere: snow cover, permafrost, and small glaciers will be studied as well as their interactions with society and potential feedbacks to the Global Earth System. Within each area of research the foci of studies will be on (a) the models’ development to improve understanding and projections of the dynamics of the Earth System in high latitudes and its interactions with the Global Earth System and (b) creation of conditions for seamless implementation of these models (e.g., organizing the input data stream for them) in a quest of answering the overarching science question and serving numerous practical applications.\n\nTasks for snow cover studies. Major issues: (a) Global Earth System modeling and numerous applications require high resolution global snow water equivalent measurements, their extension in the past, and a proper physical description of processes describing snow dynamics; (b) Having a new Cold Land Processes Mission (CLPM) as a long-term objective, the IPY is the right time for extensive and focused groundwork to secure the Mission success. Tools: (a) Extensive field campaigns and network legacy to guaranty the CLPM calibration and ongoing support over the Hemisphere; (b) Studies of compatibility of various (in-situ and remote) instrumentation and data rescue efforts; (c) Development of a portable (scalable) physically based model of short-term and seasonal snow evolution applicable to rough terrain and/or in the presence of vegetation.\n\nTasks for permafrost studies. Major issue: Permafrost changes (warming and thawing) have global consequences => these processes should be well understood, monitored, modeled, and projected. Mitigation strategies should be timely developed. Tools: (a) Establish and support a comprehensive permafrost monitoring system in the high latitudes including the Arctic coastal zone; (b) Develop reliable models accounting for changes in the permafrost and its interactions with terrestrial ecosystems, hydrology, atmosphere, and society and incorporate them into emerging global Earth System and reanalyses models; (c) Develop specialty models that seamlessly account for specifics of permafrost environment in practical applications (coastal erosion, cold land engineering, etc.)\n\nTasks for glaciers’ studies. Major issues: Increase in accuracy of monitoring of glaciers' dynamics from space and in situ observations to resolve the major uncertainties of the global glaciers' changes, first of all surface area and distribution versus elevation and surface mass balance with extrapolation from the observational network to the larger glacier systems. Tools: (a) Develop a conceptual model for areal generalization of the glaciers’ characteristics and their monitoring; (b) Develop a portable model that describes the processes of glaciers’ change in response to climate change; the model should be useable as a block in the regional and global climate models as well as for water and natural hazard management; (c) Repeat regular monitoring using laser altimetry for glaciers in CLR and blending these observations with existing long-term observational network data; (d) Assessment of direct anthropogenic impact on glaciers’ dynamics (e.g., due to air pollution). Mostly small glaciers of the Northern Hemisphere will be studied within this IPY proposal.\n\nTasks for socio-economic studies. Major issue: Fragile environment and harsh climatic conditions in high latitudes put additional stress on societal sustainability during rapid environmental changes. Tools: (a) Determine the impacts of environmental changes in high latitudes on humans in particular on the indigenous population; (b) Develop models of economic effect, both positive and negative, of the ongoing and possible climate changes, snow- glaciers- and permafrost-related hazards; (c) Develop the societal feedback loop models for use in Global Earth models; (d) Develop mitigation strategies for the populations negatively affected by contemporary and projected environmental changes.\n\nTasks for integration studies. Major issue: Need for suite of regional models that incorporate peculiarities of interactions of climate, cryosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere of high latitudes and serve as a reliable internal block to Global Earth Models. Tools: (a) Develop regional models (e.g., reanalysis, WRF, LDAS) with specialty blocks (hydrology, cold land, coastal processes, ecosystem, societal interactions) incorporating major feedbacks that are specific for high latitudinal land areas and are of global importance (e.g., potentially powerful permafrost thawing over CLR and the Arctic coastal zone – greenhouse gases emission positive feedback); (b) Develop (improve) regional numerical weather forecast models to account for specifics of the high latitudes (including specific societal needs); (c) Verify Global Climate Models’ projections in the high latitudes; (d) Organize input data stream (remote and in-situ) sufficient for operating the system that can answer the overarching science question and serve numerous practical applications.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=138",

A major airborne campaign was planned and executed in August and September of 1987 to study the sudden and unanticipated decrease observed in the abundance of ozone over Antarctica in the Austral spring since 1979. Results from that study have provided data which directly implicate man-made chemical compounds, chlorofluorocarbons, in the enormous ozone loss over this remote region in the southern hemisphere. To continue the study of the production and loss mechanisms for ozone in the polar stratosphere and to assess man's growing influence on his environment, NASA is planning a follow-on experiment to the one conducted over the Antarctic. A second major aircraft-campaign is planned for January - February 1989. The recently published Ozone Trends Panel Report found that the largest decreases in total ozone occurred during January-February at latitudes near the edge of the Arctic vortex. This experiment!  will investigate the Arctic polar stratosphere from a base in Norway.\n      \nObjectives\n     \nThe primary objectives of the 1989 Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition are:\n      \nTo study the production and loss mechanisms of ozone in the north polar stratospheric environment.\n      \nTo study the effect on ozone distribution of the Arctic polar vortex and of the cold temperatures associated with the formation of Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC's).       \n\nApproach\n      \nThe Upper Atmospheric Research Program sponsored by the NASA Office of Space Science and Applications has supported the development of instrumentation specifically designed to measure trace species critical to the understanding of stratospheric photochemistry and dynamics. This airborne instrumentation has been flown in two previous experiments: the Stratosphere-Troposphere Exchange Project and the Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment. We propose to use the suite of instruments flown in these earlier experiments to address the objectives defined for the Arctic Ozone Expedition.  We propose to operate the ER-2 out of Stavanger, Norway (59 N, 5 degrees 38'E). We are planning 10 missions, each with a duration of 7 hours, allowing a range of about 20 degrees of latitude. The field experiment will last approximately 7-8 weeks from the last week of December 1988 through the middle of February 1989. This time period should allow us to make measurements during the statistically most active period for the formation of Polar Stratospheric Clouds in the Arctic.\n      \nThe DC-8 will be deployed for the same period of time as the ER-2, and while most of the flights will be closely coordinated with those of the ER-2, many flights will be quite independent. The data from the two aircraft will be complementary. Because of its limited range, the ER-2 will not be able to survey the entire Arctic region of interest, whereas the greater range of the DC-8 will enable it to survey the polar vortex and air processed through the cold temperature region of the polar vortex. The number of flights would be comparable to those of the ER-2; the prime operating site the same as the ER-2: Stavanger, Norway.\n      \nMETEOROLOGICALLY GUIDED FLIGHT TRACKS\n      \nIn addition to normal weather forecast products to aid in flight planning from the scientific point of view, the mission will have available forecasts of air parcel trajectories and potential vorticity maps, which can be used to follow the movement of air masses of interest, and to define the vortex dynamics.       \n      \nFor more information, link to http://cloud1.arc.nasa.gov/aase/",

The ABLE-2 core research\ndata were gathered by NASA Electra aircraft flights that stretched\nfrom Belem, at the mouth of the Amazon River, west to Tabatinga, on\nthe Brazil-Colombia border, from a base at Manaus in the heart of the\nforest. These observations were supplemented by ground based chemical\nand meteorological measurements in the dry forest, the Amazon\nfloodplain, and the tributary rivers through use of enclosures, an\ninstrumented tower in the jungle, a large tethered balloon, and\nweather and ozonesondes.\n\nThis study showed air above the Amazon jungle to be extremely clean\nduring the wet season but deteroirated dramatically during the dry\nseason as the result of biomass burning, performed mostly at the edges\nof the forest. Biomass burning is also a source of greenhouse gases\ncarbon dioxide and methane, as well as other pollutants (carbon\nmonoxide and oxides of nitrogen).

The work can be subdivided into three major activities, each requiring a distinctly different approach. \n\n1) Spatial and Temporal Pattern of Net surface Accumulation. Various successful ITASE traverses of the Antarctic over the past decade have begun the process of collecting high-frequency radar soundings that, when tied to dated ice cores, provide a continuous transect of accumulation history by following dated radar horizons. We will expand these observations in two ways: by encouraging the collection of more data as part of any IPY or post-IPY traverse across Antarctica including identifying commercially available equipment that can be used to begin standardizing the international data set; and by collecting additional data with an existing airborne high-frequency radar system flown in areas that both fill in major gaps in coverage and increase the number of intersecting transect tie-points. The distributed product from this activity will be a three-dimensional mapping of numerous isochrones that represent the spatial and temporal variability of Antarctic accumulation at an unprecedented level of detail. \n\n2) Position and Velocity at the Grounding Line. These will be determined exclusively from satellite data using proven techniques. Interferometric SAR analysis has already determined many segments of the grounding line and SAR data are presently being analyzed to determine surface ice velocity over the region north of 72S. Two other satellite data sets will assist in this analysis: Landsat data, made available through a planned map mosaicing activity, will be examined to help in the delineation of the grounding line and flow rate; and satellite altimetry will provide additional indications of the grounding line transition. These data provide an earlier epoch measurement. It is hoped that a new collection of interferometric quality SAR data will be part of IPY to allow a common epoch for the data sets of surface velocity and ice thickness. The comparison of this new velocity data with the previous large-scale mapping of ice speed, as well as a wealth of isolated older measurements, will provide useful indications of the temporal variation of ice discharge and grounding line position along large portions of the Antarctic's grounded perimeter. \n\n3) Ice Thickness at the Grounding Line. These data are required to complete the calculation of ice discharge. Our goal is to make direct measurements as nearly coincident with the flow measurements, as possible. This is a very challenging task. Negotiations are continuing in countries that have operational airborne ice penetrating radars that can measure ice thickness of more than one kilometer. Some other IPY programs (e.g., ACE, PET and GIGAGAP) have indicated a willingness to include needed measurements as part of their field program. Where new measurements are not possible during IPY, or perhaps immediately thereafter, older measurements will be used. There are many existing data sets for portions of the Antarctic perimeter - the largest being from the Italian program. Additionally, we will develop the means to use satellite altimetry (ICESat and possibly Cryosat) to provide more widely spaced measurements of ice thickness inferred from surface elevations on floating ice immediately adjacent to the grounding line.",

Our taxonomic focus is the animals that drift with ocean currents throughout their lives (i.e., the holozooplankton).

CMarZ will also make use of existing data and archived zooplankton collections. The global survey design will be optimized using theoretical and numerical models in collaboration with the CoML FMAP (Future of Marine Animal Populations) project. Sampling systems will include traditional nets and trawls, remote detection, optical sensors, and integrated sensor systems deployed on towed, remotely-operated, or autonomous vehicles and submersibles (Fig. 2).

The rapidity and pervasiveness of these changes continue to present challenges to the adaptive capacity for local communities and Arctic societies (ACIA 2005, AHDR 2004). Local responses to these challenges will depend, in part, on the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of human-environment systems, where vulnerability describes the degree to which a system is likely to experience harm due to exposure to a hazard, either a perturbation or a stress, and adaptation refers to change in a system in response to some force or perturbation. Yet, the processes that shape vulnerability and adaptive capacity are not well understood. The aim of this project is to develop and apply methods for assessing the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of human systems in local Arctic communities. This analysis will enable comparison of local communities experiencing (or expected to experience) rapid and cumulative changes under different internal and external conditions. Project results will also indicate areas or actions for improving resilience. \n\nResearch Objectives\nThe research will enhance empirical and theoretical understanding of processes that shape vulnerability and adaptation across the circumpolar region by\n1. further developing the theoretical concept of vulnerability (Turner et al, 2003; Smit and Pilifosova, 2003) and refining and applying an interdisciplinary research methodology for vulnerability studies (ie. Huq and Lim, 2005; Keskitalo, 2004; Ford and Smit, 2004)\n2. identifying social and environmental factors and stresses and document the interactions which shape adaptive capacity and vulnerability.\n3. improving understanding of the interrelations between local vulnerability and decision-making across scales.\n\nActivities\nA framework for vulnerability assessment will be developed to guide field research in communities across the Arctic and to facilitate comparison and integration of results in an interdisciplinary analysis. A methodology for carrying out empirical research will be developed and applied to document the vulnerabilities of communities, including their exposures, their adaptive capacities and their adaptation strategies. The methodology involves collaboration with communities, employs case studies, engages stakeholders, integrates local and indigenous knowledge, is community and place specific, recognizes multiple sources of stimulus, and is fundamentally interdisciplinary. Data will be collected using established protocols and procedures from secondary sources (government records on socio-economic and climate conditions; satellite imagery, reports) and primary sources (interviews, focus groups, participant, questionnaires).\nThe research will be undertaken in local and indigenous communities in all eight Arctic countries:, Canada, Denmark (Greenland, Faroe Islands), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the USA.\n\nOutcomes \nThe broad contributions of the project include:\na) Development of a robust vulnerability framework and methodology for community assessment.\nb) Knowledge on the nature of the vulnerabilities, exposures and adaptive capacities of Arctic communities, compared and integrated in an analysis for the circumpolar region.\nc) Input to policy and decision-making to enhance the resilience and sustainability of Arctic communities.",

This project involves a transect from the centre of the Antarctic continent, where the ice sheet is underlain by the Gamburtsev Mountains, northwards into Prydz Bay. We will acquire major new data sets including offshore marine data, gravity, magnetics, ice radar soundings and a wealth of geological observations. This will also be part of a multinational Gamburtsev Mountains IPY expedition that will include the GAMBIT (EoI 558) regional aerogeophysical program, a Chinese drilling program (GMDP) and a passive seismic experiment (GAMSEIS - EoI 412).\n\nThe main objective is to derive a four dimensional evolutionary history of the area of East Antarctica affected by the world's largest glacier (Lambert) and associated ice shelf (Amery). The project is focused in an area that exhibits the largest set of geological exposures in East Antarctica (Prince Charles Mountains). This southern part of the transect will cover the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains. Nothing is known about the nature of this ice-covered Antarctic 'highland'. It was from this region that the expanding Antarctic ice sheet originated and it has been suggested that during warmer periods, this terrain was drained first by ice streams and then, nearer the coast, by rivers from which thick sediments accumulated. In the Late Palaeozoic and Mesozoic these sediments probably included the Amery Group of East Antarctica together with a huge succession of similarly aged sediments that were deposited in Africa, India and Australia. The modern East Antarctic ice sheet is also thought to have nucleated on this highland, and progressively expanded from there to cover the continent as Antarctica gradually cooled.\n\nThe marine sub-project will target the Lambert Rift system in the area of Prydz Bay with acquisition of deep crustal geophysical data and sediment cores that will be integrated with the continental based data sets. The sedimentary and glacial history of Prydz Bay and the structural grain of its uppermost basement are relatively well known from extensive shallow to medium depth seismic reflection profiling and ODP Legs 119 and 188. This existing information will serve as an important parameter basis to build deep dynamic crustal and lithospheric models of the evolution of the Lambert Rift system and its role in the ice-sheet dynamics of East Antarctica.\n\nThe marine geoscience activities will be facilitated through the deployment of the RV 'Polarstern' and the RV 'Akademik Alexander Karpinsky' in 2007, with a continental and airborne based program in the Prince Charles Mountains and the Gamburtsev Mountains during the 2007/08 austral summer.",

The Department will develop technologies and deploy systems\npromising an effective, reliable, and affordable missile defense\nsystem. The RDT&E program is designed to develop effective systems\nover time by developing layered defenses that employ complementary\nsensors and weapons to engage threat targets in the boost, midcourse,\nand terminal phases of flight and to deploy that capability\nincrementally.\n\nAt the direction of the Secretary of Defense, we have developed a\nresearch, development and test program that focuses on missile defense\nas a single integrated BMD system, no longer differentiating between\ntheater and national missile defense. This revised structure involves\nthree basic thrusts. First, the new BMD program will build on the\ntechnical progress we have made to date by providing the funding\nrequired to develop and test selective elements of the current program\nfully.\n\nSecond, the new program will pursue a broad range of activities in\norder to aggressively evaluate and develop technologies for the\nintegration of land, sea, air, or space-based platforms to counter\nballistic missiles in all phases of their flight. The new program will\nnot cut corners. Rather, it is designed to pursue parallel development\npaths to improve the likelihood of achieving an effective, layered\nmissile defense.\n\nThird, the new testing program will incorporate a larger number of\ntests than in the past. They will employ more realistic scenarios and\ncountermeasures. This will allow us to achieve greater confidence in\nour planning and development. Through this robust testing activity, we\nmay discover opportunities to accelerate elements of the program based\non their performance, and increase the overall credibility and\ncapability of BMD systems. This approach is designed to enable\ncontingency use of the demonstrated BMD capabilities, if directed.\n\nThe goal of the BMD System is a layered defense that provides multiple\nengagement opportunities along the entire flight path of a ballistic\nmissile. Over the next three to five years we will pursue parallel\ntechnical paths to reduce schedule and cost risk in the individual\nRDT&E efforts. We will explore and demonstrate kinetic and directed\nenergy kill mechanisms for potential sea-, ground-, air-, and\nspace-based operations to engage threat missiles in the boost,\nmidcourse, and terminal phases of flight. In parallel, sensor suites\nand battle management and command and control (BMC2) will be developed\nto form the backbone of the BMD System.\n\nFor more information, link to\n'http://www.acq.osd.mil/bmdo/bmdolink/html/system.html'",

Data\nwere collected during 3 major field experiments between 1981 and\n1985. The first focused on extended spatial coverage, whilst the\nsecond and third were concerned with repeat sampling at pre-defined\nlocations to give a temporal sequence. Data collected from these\nfield experiments were transferred to a central BIOMASS Data Centre\nto enable their standardisation for integrated analysis. The Data\nCentre was also responsible for running a series of data analysis\nworkshops. With the end of the BIOMASS Programme in 1991, the data\nset and its supporting documentation are being prepared for\ndistribution to those scientists who took part in BIOMASS and to any\nother investigators who request copies. The BIOMASS Data Centre\nfaced many problems in standardising, integrating and documenting\nthe data supplied by individual researchers into a coherent data!\nset. The majority of these problems were managerial rather than\ntechnical. There was a lack of integration of the data management\nwith the objectives of the science programme. For example, the need\nfor a BIOMASS Data Centre was identified in 1979, but it was not\nfinally established until 1986. Once established, the Data Centre\ndid not always respond to the scientific requirements of the\nprogramme. There was an over reliance on software that was developed\nwithin the Data Centre instead of using commercially available\nproducts. Time was spent creating and testing software, which would\nhave been better spent supporting data analysis.\n\nProblems were experienced in persuading individual researchers to\ncontribute data to the Data Centre. Researchers often found that the\neffort involved in submitting their data to the Data Centre was much\ngreater than the benefits they gained. Ensuring that the data were\nvalidated and of the required quality was also difficult. The task was\nhampered by the lack of supporting information about the data\nthemselves (the meta-data). Restricted access to certain data sets\nreduced the effectiveness of the BIOMASS Data Centre and it operated\nfor much of its life with a very restrictive data access\nprotocol. This was designed to protect some data sets before their\noriginators had published their own analyses, but hampered the\ndistribution of data to the wider BIOMASS community.\n\nThe lessons that have been learned from BIOMASS about the management\nof complex, large-scale, biological data sets will be of great use to\nfuture programmes. Increasing the quality of data holdings, especially\nby the inclusion of meta-data, will increase the chances of\nsuccessfully networking databases together to support biodiversity and\nother research.",

One that would move like a stream of air. One that would be light enough to be towed by a standard automobile. One that would provide first-class living accommodations anywhere in the world. Thus, over 70 years ago was born the first Airstream trailer. And with it was born yet another dream, a dream of new freedom, new places, new experiences, and new friendships. It was a dream so powerful, so enduring it did far more than create a new way of travel; it created a new way of life shared by thousands upon thousands of families.\n\nThe Airstream philosophy has always been and will always be, ' Let's not make any changes — let's make only improvements!' Every inch of an Airstream has a functional purpose. There is no planned obsolescence. This is as true in today's models as it was of the first Airstream to see the light of the open road. The classic Airstream of the thirties is no museum piece. Still in use today, it is as sturdy and modern in appearance as the first day it swung into traffic. As a result, an Airstream is always 'in style' — conceived and constructed as a lifetime investment in happiness.\n\nToday, the Airstream is the most thoroughly tested Airstream in trailer history. It is years ahead in engineering — the culmination of over 70 years of experience in trailer making, millions of miles of Caravan travel throughout the world; plus millions of miles more, run up by happy Airstream owners! More than ever, the Airstream remains a testimonial to the practical vision, the tenacity and know-how of one dedicated man — Wally Byam, and his team who made your travel dreams come true.\n\nSummary provided by http://www.airstream.com/company/index.html",

            "definition": "The ongoing global climate change has a complex signature in Antarctica. The set-back of the stratospheric ozone hole (Montreal protocol), natural variability cycles (Antarctic oscillation), a complex contribution by the southern ocean, presently result in a delayed response on a large part of the continent (east Antarctica) but a strong signature elsewhere (Peninsula, Weddell and Belingshausen sectors).\n\nIt is very likely that climate changes in the course of the present century will be significant over Antarctica (Krinner et al. 2007, Genthon et al. 2009) but the magnitude and detailed chronology of this change remains to be firmly established. Climate change over Antarctica will affect mass balance and thus sea-level with global consequences.\n\nTherefore, it is important to make sure that meteorological and climate models used to predict climate and mass balance change over Antarctica are calibrated and validated with proper field data. Such observation is necessarily of limited spatial and to some extent temporal significance. It is thus important to also improve our ability to exploit satellite information to inter- and extrapolate the field data to scales compatible with models and more generally to the full scale of Antarctica. A main point about the present [CALVA] project is is that it jointly coordinates field activities in support of both climate models and satellite remote sensing.\n\n\nThe objectives of the project CALVA is to deploy, maintain and exploit a set of automatic autonomous instrumental systems, to carry manual observations on the field , and to participate in special observing campaigns to improve calibration of and validate analysis and forecast climate models and satellite data processing algorithms. Selection of necessary data and of methods to acquire the data are thus determined by the common and specific needs of models and remote sensing.\n\nFor more information, please visit: http://www-lgge.obs.ujf-grenoble.fr/~christo/calva/",

The AHHI core project will seek to advance the joint circumpolar human health research agendas of the Arctic Council (AC; www.arcticcouncil.org ), an eight nation intergovernmental forum for sustainable development and environmental protection, and the working groups of the International Union for Circumpolar Health (IUCH). Current AC human health activities include monitoring the human health impact of anthropogenic pollutants, climate variability, infectious diseases, and the expansion and assessment of tele-health innovations in Arctic regions. The IUCH (www.iuch.org ) promotes international cooperation, research, scientific information exchange and education in the areas of Arctic Health Policy, Birth Defects & Genetics, Cancer, Diet & Heart, Environmental Health & Subsistence Food Security, Family Health, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Health Surveys, HIV/AIDS, STDs, Indigenous Peoples Health, Infectious Diseases, Injury Prevention, Occupational Safety & Health, Population-Based Planning, Tobacco & Health, and Women's Health. An anticipated outcome of the AHHI will be the development of an organizational infrastructure for the coordination of human health research activities in Arctic regions. \n\nA key element of the AHHI will be the development of new, and expansion of existing human health surveillance, monitoring and research networks. These circumpolar networks will allow the monitoring of diseases of concern in Arctic communities through the development of standardized study protocols, data collection, laboratory methods, and data analysis. Once established these networks will allow the monitoring of disease prevalence over time, the determination of risk factors for disease and evaluation and implementation of disease prevention and control strategies. Networks also provide opportunities for the development of sustainable partnerships between communities and researcher through the establishment of community-based monitoring activities. \n\nA focus of the AHHI is the establishment of research activities focusing on human health issues of concern to Arctic residents. Priority areas include the human health impact of: \n-Regional and inter-continentally transported anthropogenic pollution in Arctic regions.\n-Oil, gas and other sustainable development activities. \n-Contaminants and zoonotic infectious diseases on the traditional food supply.\n-Climate variability on human health and traditional food supply. \n-Infectious diseases including tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, vaccine preventable diseases, emerging infectious diseases such as SARS.\n-The effects of the changing Arctic environment on the evolution, ecology, and emergence of zoonotic disease, particularly avian influenza.\n-Chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and diabetes. \n-Behavioural health issues, such as suicide, interpersonal violence and substance abuse, and unintentional injuries. \nResearch activities will include the use of culturally sensitive health interview surveys which are a useful tool for characterizing health and risky behaviours, the health status of populations, and the development of culturally appropriate interventions. \n\nIn the area of health communication several symposia and topic specific work shops are planned before during and following IPY which will allow the, development of new collaborations, evaluation of advances made in the health of Arctic peoples, the health disparities that remain, and to examine future risks to the health and well-being of all Arctic residents. \n\nDetails regarding AHHI specific projects, plans and progress can be found at: www.arctichealth.org",

            "definition": "The Arctic sea ice cover is undergoing significant climate-induced changes, resulting in a reduction in ice extent and a net thinning of the sea ice cover. The sea ice cover plays an important role in the global climate system, both as an indicator and an amplifier of environmental change. It is important to continue and expand long-term observations of these changes to improve the fundamental understanding of the role of the sea ice cover in the global climate system and its utility as a climate change indicator. This formidable task spans an extensive range of temporal and spatial scales. An integrated, coordinated, and interdisciplinary approach will be used to monitor the state of the Arctic sea ice cover and investigate its governing processes. There are numerous tools that will be brought to bear on this task, including satellite remote sensing, autonomous rovers, buoys, ocean moorings, field campaigns and numerical models. Satellite remote sensing provides large-scale descriptions of such basic parameters as ice distribution, melt zone, ice motion, and cloud fraction at intervals of half a day to a week. Buoys and moorings will contribute high temporal resolution and can measure parameters currently unavailable from space such as atmospheric fluxes, ice thickness, internal ice temperature, photographs of surface conditions, and ocean temperature and salinity. The fixed observing systems will be complemented by autonomous mobile platforms including aerial vehicles, underwater vehicles, and land vehicles. A coordinated array of such vehicles, with integrated sensor systems, will provide spatial and temporal coverage that has previously been unavailable. Field campaigns will be used to explore, in detail, the state of the ice cover and the processes that govern the ice cover. The campaigns will be pan-Arctic including areas that have been largely unexamined, such as the region north of Greenland. Process studies will examine the interactions of the lower atmosphere, ice surface, and upper ocean that are crucial for understanding and modeling the the pack ice mass balance. Special attention will be paid to the impact of the hetereogeneity of the snow and ice on thermodynamic and dynamic processes. New techniques will be employed, such as isotope analysis of sea ice samples for information on surface water mass changes. Numerical models will be used to assess the character of the changes in the ice cover and predict their impacts on the rest of the climate system. Models will also assist in planning the observation program. The synthesis of the observations and models will provide a comprehensive picture of Arctic change. The seasonal ice zone (SIZ), which is predicted to extend over most of the Arctic Ocean by mid-century, is of particular interest. Given the challenges of operating in the SIZ environment, data for this component of the cryosphere are lacking, making it impossible to effectively predict the consequences of this dramatic change. We plan to obtain a comprehensive data set of key biophysical variables describing the evolution and state of the seasonal ice zone. The activities will examine the role of the snow cover in atmosphere-ice-ocean interaction, shifting patterns of spatio-temporal variability in sub-Arctic and Arctic seas, the important role of ice-associated biological communities in Arctic ecosystems, and latitudinal and bi-polar contrasts in atmosphere-ice-ocean interaction and biodiversity. Recent sea ice ecosystem changes will be assessed and potential future changes and their consequent impacts on higher trophic levels will be estimated. The International Polar Year will be an extraordinary opportunity to capture the imagination of students and the public. We will use this opportunity to convey not only information about the Arctic sea ice cover and its role in global climate, but also an understanding and an appreciation of science in general. We propose an extensive educational outreach component that will include media contacts, web sites, public lectures, and K-12 classroom programs. Undergraduate and graduate students will be entrained in all aspects of the our work from the planning stage to the field observations and modeling. A two week long International Summer School on Sea Ice will be held at the University Centre in Svalbard to increase the knowledge of sea ice related geophysics among both students and scientists, faciliate interdisciplinary research, and stimulate international cooperation.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=95",

Furthermore, hydrological models and data assimilation techniques will be developed to generate a comprehensive, integrated description of the AHC including the feedbacks between the atmosphere, cryosphere and the oceans. The project will have a data management and information system in accordance with IPY and WMO protocol. It will establish links with other relevant clusters, e.g. on meteorology, climatology, cryosphere, including permafrost, snow-cover and glaciers, biosphere and societal issues affected by the AHC.\n\nThe Arctic-HYCOS is the core network of the Arctic-HYDRA. This system is intended to provide hydrological information of a high quality, both historical as well as near real time data. It will provide an important benchmark for understanding future change to the AHC; information essential to the longer term ICARPII-WG7 program. The system will be based on the existing national data bases and observation systems in the Arctic countries that have historical long-term observation series on the large rivers discharging to the Arctic Ocean, as well as stations on tributaries and smaller rivers. The Arctic-HYCOS network will meet the requirements of WMO-HYCOS. During the International Polar Year (IPY) four test hydrological stations are to be established in the Mackenzie (Canada), Lena and Pechora (Russia) and Tana (Norway, Finland) river basins. It is envisaged that additional sites will be established in accordance with the broader plan of the Arctic-HYCOS and ICARPII-WG7 program. \n\nTo complement the core network, a set of Long Term Hydrological Observatories (LTHOs) will be established in Arctic North America and Eurasia. They will collect basic hydrologic data such as precipitation, stream flow, groundwater levels, etc. as well as meteorological and biogeochemical data. In Alaska a LTHO (the Kuparuk River) will serve as an international natural laboratory dedicated to understanding the dynamic interactions between hydrological, ecological and climatological processes. Another LTHO will be established in the Eurasian Continent with focus on the ocean/atmospheric interactions with the hydrological cycle, including radio-sonde observation, radar measurement, GPS and solid precipitation measurements. Similar LTHO or network of research basins will focus on advancing our understanding and description of land surface cryospheric processes in order to improve the predictive capacity of Arctic atmospheric, cryospheric and hydrological models at small to medium scales. This will include observations of snow accumulation, over-winter ablation processes, snowmelt, soil thermodynamics, infiltration and water redistribution in frozen and thawing soils and cold regions water balance components in non-frozen periods. Two additional LTHOs will focus on the impact of aerosols on the AHC with supplementary UAV measurements and enhanced surface observations. The LTHO observations will be used to improve atmospheric, hydrologic and cryospheric process representations and also to evaluate meso-scale representations in models and assess model performance and sensitivity in multi-criteria prediction. The LTHO network will form the platform for developing the 'supersites' of monitoring and research activities identified for the ICARPII-program.\n\nThe Arctic-Hydra executes a strategy for synthesis and integration studies of the AHC based on the Arctic-RIMS project. It will produce time-varying aerological and land surface water budgets including river and ice melt inputs to the Arctic Ocean. All key elements of the terrestrial and ocean water balance will be provided, including an assessment of potential error. A guiding philosophy of the proposed research is to 'stay close to the data' although both data assimilation and modelling systems will be used for generalizations. The use of observations, either by themselves or as model drivers, provides a 'reality-based' framework to understand observed variability and change in the Arctic system.",

            "definition": "While there is an increasing awareness of the importance of Antarctic research, the 14 million km² Antarctic continent still only houses two permanent inland research stations, Amundsen-Scott and Vostok. Recognizing the unique research opportunities offered by the Antarctic Plateau, the French and Italian Antarctic program agreed in 1993 to cooperate in developing a permanent research support facility at Dome C. The new station, named “Concordia” (75°06’ S -123°23’ E), will be opened for wintering in 2005. However, the two first years will be mainly dedicated to the achievement of the buildings, tests of safety protocols and settlement of some scientific equipment. For this reason, Concordia is expected to be fully operational when the International Polar Year starts, in 2007. Dome C has several valuable characteristics that support the installation of a permanent scientific station: A substantial layer of ice, about 3,300m thick, offers great potential for climatic reconstruction. Ice cores were collected by the EPICA program, a European project involving 10 countries, and more than 900,000 years of climatic records are expected from these samples. In addition, numerous small lakes have been detected in vicinity of Concordia, giving opportunities for exploration and tests of new technologies for the exploration sub-glacial environment. The area corresponds almost to the centre of the polar vortex, a major component of the Antarctic Oscillation driving the heat and mass exchanges between the Antarctic continent and the surrounding ocean-sea-ice-atmosphere coupled system. This area is also suitable for studying the ozone depletion and the subsequent cooling of the stratosphere in spring. The Concordia station is a vantage central Antarctic site to analyze polar meteorological high-resolution data and to evaluate the performance of satellite instruments in terms of local and large scale circulation, surface meteorology and processes, boundary layer and free atmosphere meteorological profiles… The Antarctic Plateau is a well recognised, favourable site for astronomic observations due to its geographic location and its extremely dry, cold, rarefied and stable atmosphere. Millimetric/microwave polarimeters can exploit their high sensitivity in Dome-C, rivalling with space based instruments in selected sky areas. Dome-C is the only built location on the Earth where the 200 micron window is usable; the extremely low atmospheric emissivity will also allow optimal use of the other mm/sub-mm atmospheric windows for Galactic, Extragalactic and Cosmological studies. Dome C is a particularly promising location, at critical distance from highly active seismic regions to allow optimal sampling of the deep mantle and the core in crucial geometries. Besides, it is situated on the East Antarctic plateau about 1,000 km away from the coast in a site potentially very quiet and therefore ideal for seismographic observations. Dome C, at 3,233m above the continental crust, is protected from any magnetic perturbations by earth crust anomalies and is an ideal place for studying magnetism. Concordia is also a unique place to study the Earth-Solar relations within the particular polar cap region, and to understand their symmetrical and asymmetrical properties with respect to the Northern hemisphere Dome C is as a very isolated site with severe climatic conditions. It will be an excellent site for evaluating techniques and procedures for future work on other planets. It is also an excellent site for studying small groups of people in conditions close to those encountered in space vehicles or orbital stations. So, Concordia Station will be a new earth observatory and a logistic centre permitting the exploration of the East Antarctic plateau and giving opportunities to deploy new technical challenges and international projects.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/details.php?id=888",

Natural or social science\ntop of page\n2.0 SUMMARY OF THE ACTIVITY\n\nRapid regional warming of air temperature on the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) observed over the last 50 yrs is exceptional and unprecedented within the past 500 yrs records of ice core data (Vaughan et al. 2001, Science 293). At Vernadsky Station (former Faraday, Beascochea Bay) aerial warming averages 0.56°C per decade since the 1950s (Turner et al. 2005, Int. J. Climatol. 25: 279-294). The glacial systems of the Antarctic Peninsula show direct responses to the climatic changes, including retreat of ice fronts and increased melt water production. The broad pattern of glacial retreat over time reflects the trend of atmospheric warming in the peninsula region since the 1940s: the magnitude of glacial retreat (average change in m a-1) increases towards the southern sectors (Cook et al. 2005, Science 308). It results that changes of terrestrial as well as marine ecosystems along the Peninsula are expected to be more subtle and graded in the North and more radical at the South-Western coasts of the WAP. A directly and plausibly relatable effect of glacial retreat along WAP is the opening of newly ice-free areas for the colonization of terrestrial and intertidal plant vegetation and animals. The ClicOPEN initiative is aimed at investigating the response of terrestrial and marine coastal systems to ongoing climate change in 4 areas of interest along the WAP. Comparative work can be carried out at Mac Murdo, Ross Sea, where climate change is far less (0.1°C/decade, Kejna & Lagun, Polish Polar Studies, 2004).\nRationale of ClicOPEN: Locally increased import of fresh water from melting glaciers and increased sediment import from rock abrasion (by both, glacial melting and aerosol transport) are anticipated primary effects in coastal marine ecosystems. Warming and freshening of surface waters will impact shallow intertidal habitats. Freshening and shading induced changes of benthic and pelagic primary production and the alterations in the phytoplankton community composition are prone to alter quality and quantity of food supply for zooplankton, as well as for benthic filter and detritus feeders. This may entail important changes of trophic coupling in the coastal food webs. In the terrestrial sphere, an impact of glacial retreat and climate warming on the genetic diversity and evolutionary fitness of sessile lichens and bryophytes through range shifts and associated bottleneck effects is expected, and will be investigated using molecular markers. The climatic changes that propagate glacial melting on the WAP are prone also to impinge on Antarctic bottom communities and sediment composition in more remote areas of the Southern Ocean (e.g. South Georgia, South Orkneys, Weddell Sea). Loss of sea ice has been observed in several places beginning in the 1970s (Parkinson 2002). The reduction in sea ice correlates with a loss of krill stock density, likely to entail severe changes within coastal Antarctic food webs (Loeb et al. 1997, Nature 387, Atkinson et al. 2004, Nature 432). The ClicOPEN project aims to link the effects of glacial melting at the coast and the processes in key habitats at the shelf ice edge under focus in other EoIs like, CCAMLR (IPY 148), HABIPOL (IPY 543) and 'Census of Antarctic Marine Life (CAML)'. The objectives within the ClicOPEN approach are dual:\nA) to analyze and quantify effects of glacial melting and increased rock erosion on terrestrial and near shore marine ecosystems on a latitudinal gradient along the Western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula.\nB) to provide a basis for a mechanistic understanding of climate change processes at the peninsula that will serve to draw a link to present and future changes in more remote shelf regions of the Southern Ocean.\nClicOPEN is land based and uses existing Antarctic research stations in 4 different areas of the Antarctic Peninsula as platforms for synoptic field and laboratory studies during the IPY. Comparative work at McMurdo, Ross Sea is intended. A station based programme enables us to include many scientists into cooperative and comparative work, make use of the existing logistic background provided by field stations and home institutions, and also to draw from historical data sets in locations of long-term scientific records, including temperature records and documented contours of ice caps and glaciers.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=34",

            "definition": "A global study of seamount ecosystems, to determine their role in the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity, and evolution of marine organisms, and to evaluate the effects of human exploitation.\n\nSeamounts are ubiquitous features of the world's underwater topography and may play an important role in patterns of marine biogeography, potentially supporting high biodiversity and unique biological communities. Seamounts are often highly productive ecosystems, and may act as feeding grounds for fishes, marine mammals and seabirds. They are targeted for resource extraction such as fisheries and mining, but are ecologically vulnerable to such exploitation. At a global scale their biodiversity is poorly known with relatively few (< 200 of an estimated 100 000) seamounts having been studied in any detail.\n\nCenSeam commenced in 2005 and the CenSeam science community, with particular input from CenSeam's Data Analysis Working Group (DAWG), has defined two overarching priority themes (1) What factors drive community composition and diversity on seamounts, including any differences between seamounts and other habitat types? (2) What are the impacts of human activities on seamount community structure and function?\n\nCenSeam has been working to coordinate existing and planned programs for maximum benefit, catalyze new seamount sampling activities, align research approaches and data collection where possible to ensure that opportunities for collaboration between programs are maximized, and integrate and analyze incoming information to create new knowledge. The program is working toward standardizing sampling methods (through the Standardisation Working Group, SWG) and data reporting (through the DAWG) wherever possible, to facilitate comparisons of biodiversity between areas.\n\nCenSeam is helping to guide future sampling with a global perspective to fill critical knowledge gaps and target understudied regions and types of seamounts. In addition to fostering new expeditions, CenSeam is also consolidating and synthesizing existing data. OBIS is served by the open-access SeamountsOnline database (http://seamounts.sdsc.edu/), which is continually being expanded to include more physical and oceanographic data, and new data as they become available. This integrated seamount database is key to comprehensive synthesis and analysis of data as the program develops.\n\nCenSeam's website is continually updated and CenSeam newsletters are regularly circulated (and can additionally be downloaded from the website; http://censeam.niwa.co.nz/censeam_news/newsletters). As well as serving the science community, the website targets students and members of the public with ship-to-shore logs and features on some of the weird and wonderful creatures found on seamounts (http://censeam.niwa.co.nz/outreach/censeam_creatures).\n\nBy the end of the Census in 2010, much will remain unknowable given the large number of seamounts, their widespread distribution, and large variability in physical characteristics and habitat type. But under CenSeam much progress will be made to improve our understanding of, and erect new paradigms about, seamount ecosystems.\n\nSummary provided by http://censeam.niwa.co.nz/",

Integrating data and information from among the ARCSS ocean-based, land-based, ice core, paleoclimate and human-dimension communities is a high priority at the ADCC. \n      \nAll NSIDC data, including ARCSS data, are described and available via NSIDC Data Products and Services. However, the National Center for Atmoshperic Research's (NCAR) Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL) is now the primary ARCSS data site.

The goal of this project is to document actual species diversity of abyssal plans as a basis for global change research and for a better understanding of historical causes and actual ecological factors regulating biodiversity. To achieve this, CeDAMar will collect reliable data on the large-scale distribution of one of the largest and most inaccessible environments on our planet.\n \nThe Deep Unkown\nThe deep sea harbors vast numbers of species, most of which are still unknown. Global estimates of marine species vary between 500,000 and 10 million. Since there is no inventory of the fauna of even a single ocean basin, extrapolation of total species numbers of the global abyssal fauna is impossible or at best very speculative. The program will focus on benthic, epibenthic and hyperbenthic organisms because of their high species-richness.\n\nThe study of the deep sea offers a number of advantages. Environmental factors appear to be more homogenous in the deep sea than in many other environments and are easier to measure due to the relative uniformity of large areas. Anthropogenic effects are reduced, and communities are for the most part found in their natural state. Geological information on kinds and age of the sediments in the deep sea is available from past and ongoing projects.\n\nScientific Objectives\nCeDAMar will develop standardized protocols for surveying marine organisms in abyssal marine sediments, including reliable collecting devices in order to avoid damage to fragile deepsea animals. The standard protocols will enable results from different ocean basins will be comparable today as well as in the future. CeDAMar will also contribute to the development and testing of new, more efficient collecting techniques.\n\nSamples will be collected along approximately 1000 km long transects. To exclude small-scale variations which could influence biodiversity estimations, larger areas will be sampled with an epibenthic sledge and repeated box corer (or new devices with the same function) and multicorer hauls. Underwater cameras will document the morphology of the ocean bed, the effects of bioturbation and the abundance of microfauna. The collected material will be analyzed with modern systematic methods.\n\nSummary provided by http://www.coml.org/projects/census-diversity-abyssal-marine-life-cedamar",

            "definition": "The Census of Marine Life is a global network of researchers in more than 80 nations engaged in a 10-year scientific initiative to assess and explain the diversity, distribution, and abundance of life in the oceans. The world's first comprehensive Census of Marine Life - past, present, and future - will be released in 2010.\n\nThe stated purpose of the Census of Marine Life is to assess and explain the diversity, distribution, and abundance of marine life. Each plays an important role in what is known, unknown, and may never be known about what lives in the global ocean.\n\nFirst, diversity. The Census aims to make for the first time a comprehensive global list of all forms of life in the sea. No such unified list yet exists. Census scientists estimate that about 230,000 species of marine animals have been described and reside in jars in collections in museums of natural history and other repositories. Since the Census began in 2000, researchers have added more than 5600 species to the lists. They aim to add many thousands more by 2010. The database of the Census already includes records for more than 16 million records, old and new. By 2010, the goal is to have all the old and the new species in an on-line encyclopedia with a webpage for every species. In addition, we will estimate how many species remain unknown, that is, remain to be discovered. The number could be astonishingly large, perhaps a million or more, if all small animals and protists are included. For comparison, biologists have described about 1.5 million terrestrial plants and animals.\n\nSecond, distribution. The Census aims to produce maps where the animals have been observed or where they could live, that is, the territory or range of the species. Knowing the range matters a lot for people concerned about, for example, possible consequences of global climate change.\n\nThird, abundance. No Census is complete without measures of abundance. We want to know not only that there is such a thing as a Madagascar crab but how many there are. For marine life, populations are being estimated either in numbers or in total kilos, called biomass.\n\nTo complete the context, it is important to understand the top motivations for the Census of Marine Life. Most importantly, much of the ocean is unexplored. Most of the records in its database are for observations near the surface, and down to 1000 meters. No observations have been made in most of the deep ocean, while most of the ocean is deep.\n\nAnother important issue is that diversity varies in space. Marine hot spots, like the rain forests of the land, exist off for large fish off the coasts of Brazil and Australia. The goal is to know much more about marine hot spots, to help conserve these large fish. Their abundance and thus their diversity is changing, especially for commercially important species. Between 1952 and 1976, for example, fishermen and their customers emptied many areas of the ocean of tuna.\n\nThe Census has evolved a strategy of 14 field projects to touch the major habitats and groups of species in the global ocean. Eleven field projects address habitats, such as seamounts or the Arctic Ocean. Three field projects look globally at animals that either traverse the seas or appear globally distributed: the top predators such as tuna and the plankton and the microbes. The projects employ a mix of technologies. These include acoustics or sound, optics or cameras, tags placed on individual animals that store or report data, and genetics, as well as some actual capture of animals. The technologies complement one another. Sound can survey large areas in the ocean, while light cannot. Light can capture detail and characters that sound cannot. And genetics can make identifications from fragments of specimens or larvae where pictures tell little.\n\nThis mix of curiosity, need to know, technology, and scientists willing to investigate the unexplored and undiscovered will result in a Census of Marine Life in 2010 that provides a much clearer picture of what lives below the surface around the globe. Several reasons make such a report timely, indeed urgent. Crises in the sea are reported regularly. One recent study predicted the end of commercial fishery globally by 2050, if current trends persist. Better information is needed to fashion the management that will sustain fisheries, conserve diversity, reverse losses of habitat, reduce impacts of pollution, and respond to global climate change. Hence, there are biological, economic, philosophical and political reasons to push for greater exploration and understanding of the ocean and its inhabitants. Indeed, the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity requires signatories to collect information on living resources, but, as yet, no nation has a complete baseline of such information. The Census of Marine Life's global network of researchers will help to fill this knowledge gap, providing critical information to help guide decisions on how to manage global marine resources for the future.\n\nSummary provided by http://www.coml.org/",

We propose to deploy an array of four SHARPs (Seismic and High-frequency Acoustic Recording Packages) circumpolarly around the Antarctic Continent, over year-long periods. We will collect data on acoustic call characteristics and source level for a broad range of marine mammal and other species. The improved technology for passive monitoring will allow us to expand the range of marine mammal species monitored to include the largest odontocetes: sperm (Physeter macrocephalus), killer (Orcinus orca), beaked (Mesoplodon spp), and possibly southern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon planifrons), all the mysticetes known to inhabit the Southern Ocean: blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (B. physalus), sei (B. borealis), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), southern right (Eubalaena australis), and minke whales (B. bonaerensis), as well as most pinnipeds: leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx), Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii), crabeater (Lobodon carcinophagus), Ross (Ommatophoca rossii), southern elephant (Mirounga leonine), and fur seals. Fish choruses should also be present in these data and are know to produce sounds with diurnal variability. The acoustic data will be used to investigate the seasonality and abundance of these species in the Southern Ocean, as well as the ways that physical and biological processes interact to determine the patterns of distribution and abundance of cetaceans in the Antarctic.\n\nAt the same time this project will fill a large gap in global seismic coverage by placing seafloor seismic sensors at Southern Ocean locations, far from existing sites. These seismic sensors will lead to a more uniform coverage for seismic wave propagation within the Earth, and better understanding of local seismicity in the Southern Ocean.\n\nThe recording packages that we propose to deploy in the Southern Ocean are a proto-type ocean observatory. They have significant data recording capacity (1600 Gbytes) and can support batteries sufficient for year-long deployments of seismic, acoustic and other sensors. We plan to expand the range of sensors recorded by these instruments beyond the seismic/acoustic sensors currently proposed, and in so doing create a facility for long-term multi-disciplinary observations.\n\nThis proposal will have a broader impact on society by providing support for graduate education, developing infrastructure for future multi-disciplinary observation platforms, and providing support for outreach projects. The development of SHARPs will advance our capabilities for scientific monitoring and will serve as starting platforms for future, more integrated observation stations. This project will serve as an educational platform to enable K-12 students to virtually experience Antarctica in a way that represents its geographic and biologic diversity. To this end, we will incorporate educational material gathered from this experiment into our museum exhibit “Voices in the Sea” at the Aquarium of the Pacific (Long Beach, CA),\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=52",

The major components of this interdisciplinary research objective are modelling and ice composition studies.\n\nThe aim of this research network is to clarify the dynamic interactions between the ice sheet and its boundary conditions, such as the substratum, based on analysis of ice from the basal part of the Antarctic ice sheet and ice-sheet modelling. Results from the analyses will put constraints on the basal boundary conditions of the numerical model and will make validation of the model possible with regard to the melting and refreezing processes at the base. Further constraints come from radio-echo sounding (RES) surveys and SAR interferometric applications. For this purpose, the high-resolution numerical model of complex ice flow will be adapted to three-dimensions and refined. With the numerical model we hope to translate the results of the ice-composition analyses into physical processes, hence providing the scientific community with a model tool of complex basal interaction. As basal processes play an important role in the onset of fast-flowing areas such as ice streams, the role of ice streams, outlet glaciers and ice shelves in the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet and their influence on the variability of the ice sheet with changing climate will be investigated.",

This is on account of the extremely cold, dry and stable air found there. The exceptional site conditions would allow observations to be made of the cosmos, with greater sensitivity and clarity, and across a wider part of the electromagnetic spectrum, than from temperate-latitude sites. This IPY project aims to quantify these conditions at four sites, Summit in Greenland, Ellesmere Island in Canada, and Domes A and C on the Antarctic plateau, and then to begin the process of turning these sites into frontline observatories. Dome A is likely to be the pre-eminent location on the Earth for observational astronomy, but has only recently been visited by humans (China in 2005). Dome C is the site for a new station (France/Italy, fully operational in 2005), and already shows indications for better seeing conditions than for any existing observatory. Summit Station (Denmark/USA) and Ellesmere Island (Canada) are also extremely cold and dry. They are the best prospective observing sites in the northern polar regions and their conditions have not yet been quantified.\n\nThe project builds upon a decade of site testing experience, at both the South Pole and at Dome C, including the development of autonomous observatories that can gather the data over the winter. In particular, it will make use of AASTINOs (Automated Astrophysical Site Testing International Observatories) to conduct a range of experiments at each site, and to transmit the data to their operations centres via satellite phones. Measurements made will include the sky brightness (auroral in the optical, thermal emission in the infrared), the optical seeing and the transparency, precipitable water vapour content and microturbulence levels in the atmosphere, as well as the meteorological conditions. These will provide the baseline data needed to quantitatively assess what future astronomical facilities could be built in the polar regions, and the science programs they could tackle. The AASTINO's and their experimental suites will need to be brought to the four sites by overland traverse or by air transportation, with the scientists taken in by air to assemble them.\n\nWhile the sites have not been fully characterised, it is already clear that the Antarctic plateau sites are superior to any existing observatories for a range of frontline experiments. This IPY project will also be used to instigate pathfinder experiments aimed at tackling fundamental problems in astrophysics, in particular to test enabling technologies that will make them possible. These experiments will, in turn, lead to the development of new frontline facilities beyond the IPY. The science program we would conduct with these facilities includes measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave radiation background resulting from the Big Bang, the use of optical and infrared telescopes to examine the formation of galaxies, sub-millimetre and terahertz frequency telescopes and interferometers to probe the dense molecular clouds where stars are born, the search for other earth-like planets in the Galaxy using interferometric and microlensing techniques, and the measurement of the earthshine from the Moon to probe the variations in the Earth's albedo, primarily resulting from changing cloud cover.\n\nA critical design review of the project will be held during the SCAR meeting in Hobart in 2006. An international science meeting on Astronomy in the Polar Regions will also be organised for 2007, possibly in the UK or Greenland.",

While visible and\nnear-infrared sensors cannot see through clouds and require\nadequate solar illumina!  tion, which is a frequent and severe\nlimitation in cold regions during winter [Cline and Carroll,\n1999], measurements of the Earth surface in the microwave\nspectral regions can be largely insensitive to weather\nconditions and solar illumination. These properties make\nmicrowave remote sensing attractive for providing spatially\ndistributed information to improve and update land-surface\nmodels for cold regions, either through assimilation of\nstate-variable information estimated from microwave remote\nsensing observations using inversion algorithms, or possibly\neven through direct assimilation of microwave remote sensing\ndata themselves.\n\nThe specific objectives of the Cold Land Processes Field\nExperiment are to:\n\n1. Evaluate and improve snow water equivalent retrieval\nalgorithms for space-borne passive microwave sensors\n(e.g. SSM/I and AMSR-E);\n\n2. Evaluate and improve radar retrieval algorithms for snow\ndepth, density, and wetness, and soil freeze/thaw status;\n\n3. Improve radar retrieval algorithms to enable discrimination\nof freeze/thaw status of different surfaces (i.e. snow, soil,\nand vegetation); Examine the effects of scale (spatial\nresolution) on the skill of active and passive microwave remote\nsensing retrieval algorithms for snow and freeze/thaw status;\n\n4. Evaluate and improve spatially distributed, uncoupled\nsnow/soil models and coupled cold land surface schemes from\npoint scales to typical mesoscale grid-resolutions\n(i.e. 25-km);\n\n5. Examine the feasibility of coupling forward microwave\nradiative-transfer schemes to spatially distributed snow/soil\nmodels, to improve assimilation of microwave remote sensing\ndata;\n\n6. Examine the spatial variability of snow and frozen soil\ndistributions in different environments and a) improve the\nrepresentation of subgrid-scale variability of snow and frozen\nsoil in coupled and uncoupled land surface models, and b)\nimprove the representation of orographic precipitation\n(snowfall) in atmospheric models;\n\n7. Examine methods of extending local-scale, process-oriented\nequations describing important cold-land hydrologic and\nboundary layer properties to larger scales typical of regional\nand global atmospheric and hydrologic models.\n\nFor more information, link to\n'http://www.nohrsc.nws.gov/~cline/clpx.html'\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]",

            "definition": "An expectation of Canada’s full membership in SCAR is the development of a Canadian Antarctic research program. In its strategy document “Antarctic Science and Bipolar Linkages “ (CPC 2002) the Canadian Committee for Antarctic Research (CCAR) identified the creation of a Canadian Antarctic Research Program (CARP) as one of its highest priorities. In 2003 CCAR organised an international workshop (Polar Connections) to identify areas of Canadian scientific expertise that will form the basis of CARP. During IPY, polar science will be in the national and international spotlight and it will be an ideal time for Canada to launch CARP. A Canadian Antarctic Research Program will provide support for Canadian research activities in Antarctica and will compliment traditional sources of research funding (NSERC, SSHRC, CIHR).\n\nCanadian scientists have conducted research in Antarctica for decades, but in the absence of a national program Canadians participate as part of national programs of other countries. CARP will allow Canadians to design and lead their own research projects and participate in or even lead international projects. Canada does not intend to build a research base in Antarctica but through CARP Canadian researchers will buy space and support from other countries.\n\nAt the heart of CARP is a science program emphasising (but not limited to) three scientific themes where Canadian researchers are already active:\nTheme 1, Contaminants, biota and polar microbial ecosystems,\nTheme 2, Ice observations, ice sheet dynamics and environmental change,\nTheme 3, Polar desert landscape ecology and geomorphology.\nThe research team involved in contaminants, biota and polar microbial ecosystems is the most advanced in its research planning with Antarctic partnerships and active field programs with France, UK, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. Contaminants in polar environments are a serious problem and are an area of science where Canada is a recognised world leader. This research is truly bipolar in nature and has tremendous value for the people of northern Canada. Canadian researchers and technologies also have international recognition in the area of ice observations and environmental change. For example RADARSAT is one of the most widely used remote sensing platforms in the analysis of Antarctic ice sheet and ice shelf dynamics. Several Canadians are involved in ongoing ice research in both Polar Regions as well as ice sheet modelling, reconstruction and neotectonics. This research will compliment activities in the Canadian Arctic that is included in several other IPY proposals. Research activities in various aspects of Antarctic landscape ecology; geomorphology and paleoenvironmental reconstruction is underway by several Canadian researchers in partnership with New Zealand, Italy, USA, UK and Bulgaria. The main focus of this theme will be an investigation of landscape relationships along an environmental gradient in the McMurdo Dry Valleys region. Research outside of these theme areas will also need to be supported by CARP. Data management is also a key component of CARP and plans include the use of innovative GIS tools developed by Canadian researchers involved in the Cybercartographic Atlas of Antarctica.\n\nCARP will provide the basis for a co-ordinated program of Canadian Antarctic research. CARP will serve as a focus for Canadian Antarctic research, working with relevant agencies and organisations to articulate science objectives that reflect Canada’s need for information about Antarctica. CARP provides a vehicle for grouping all Canadian IPY proposals with bipolar and antarctic activities.\n\nThe Earth’s Polar Regions drive many global systems and with uncertainties about global climate change looming large the need for information about both Polar Regions has never been greater. As a polar nation Canada needs to be concerned with both the Arctic and the Antarctic as part of the global system.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=329",

Climate ecosystem biogeochemistry interactions in the Southern Ocean \n5. Records of past Antarctic climate variability and change \n\nThis proposal describes IPY activities grouped in the Antarctic Ocean Circulation cluster of EOIs that contribute to the goals of CASO.\n\nObjectives:\n1. To obtain a synoptic circumpolar snapshot of the physical environment of the Southern Ocean (collaboration with other IPY activities will extend the snapshot to include biogeochemistry, ecology, and biodiversity).\n2. To enhance understanding of the role of the Southern Ocean in past, present and future climate, including connections between the zonal and meridional circulation of the Southern Ocean, water mass transformation, atmospheric variability, ocean-cryosphere interactions, physical-biogeochemical-ecological linkages, and teleconnections between polar and lower latitudes.\n\nOutcomes/Deliverables:\n1. Improved climate predictions, from models that incorporate a better understanding of southern polar processes.\n2. Proof of concept of a viable, cost-effective, sustained observing system for the southern polar regions (including ocean, atmosphere and cryosphere).\n3. A baseline for the assessment of future change.\n\nMajor field programs:\n1. A circumpolar array of full-depth multi-disciplinary hydrographic sections and XBT/XCTD sections, extending from the Antarctic continent northward across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, including key water mass formation regions (EOIs 109, 173, 225 284, 599, 730, 770, 806, 924, 51, 350, 283, 584, 911, 271, 440, 596).\n2.

Profiling floats deployed throughout the Southern Ocean, including acoustically-tracked floats in ice-covered areas (109, 180, 599, 485, 596).\n4. Current meter moorings to provide time series of ocean currents and water mass properties at key passages, in centres of action of dominant modes of variability, and in areas of bottom water formation and export (109, 173, 225, 599, 604, 806, 51, 596).\n5. Environmental sensors deployed on marine mammals (77, 596).\n6. Direct measurements of diapycnal and isopycnal mixing rates in the Southern Ocean (183).\n7. Analysis of ice cores, sediment cores and deep corals to extend observations of Southern Ocean variability back beyond the instrumental era (109, 806, 51).\n8. Bottom pressure gauges will be used near Drake Passage to monitor ocean currents, validate tidal models, and improve regional corrections to satellite altimeter products (567, 580).\n9. Automatic weather stations, flux measurements in the boundary layer and drifters to measure atmospheric variability (pressure, winds, heat and freshwater flux) (108, 109). \n\nThe observations will be integrated closely with modelling studies using a variety of approaches (coupled climate models; high resolution ocean-ice models; atmospheric models; tidal models; Lagrangian diagnostics; 320, 284, 567, 580, 590,117).",

These LIDAR measurements provide high resolution vertical profiles of the upper tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols. The LIDAR system has evolved over the years and provides a valuable long-term history of the middle-latitude stratospheric aerosol.\n\nProject Description:\nThe measurements for ARB were made using a LIDAR system.  This system uses a ruby laser that emits one joule per pulse with a repeat rate of 0.15 hertz (Hz) at a wavelength of 0.6943 micrometers.  This system also uses a 48 inch cassegrainian configured telescope mounted on a movable platform.  The transmitter laser beam has a divergence of about 1.0 mrad, and the maximum receiver field of view is 4.0 mrad. The LIDAR has a signal bandwidth of 1 MHz, and this is equal to a 150 meter vertical resolution.  Three photomultiplier tubes are used to enhance the dynamic range.  These tubes are electronically switched on at specific times after the laser has been fired.  The photomultiplier tube output signals are processed by 12-bit Computer Automated Measurement and Control (CAMAC) based digitizers and acquired by a personal computer.\n\nData Used and Produced:\nThe Aerosol Research Branch (ARB) 48-inch LIDAR (ARB_48_IN_LIDAR) data set contains data collected from a 48-inch LIDAR system located at NASA Langley Research Center.  Each granule consists of one year of data.  Data are available from 1982 through the present.  Data are continuously being collected.  The days of data are different in each granule.  Each measurement consists of four parameters: stratospheric integrated backscatter from tropopause to 30 km, altitude levels, scattering ratio at each altitude level, and aerosol backscattering coefficient at each altitude level.  An image has been produced to represent the data collected for each granule.\n\nProject Archive Contact:  Langley DAAC User Services Office\n                                Mail Stop 157D\n                                NASA Langley Research Center\n                                Hampton, VA 23681-0001\n                                USA\n                                Phone: (757) 864-8656\n                                Email: support-asdc@earthdata.nasa.gov\n                                WWW:  http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/\n\n      Project Manager Contact:  M.

The area is characterized by large\nscale subsidence and therefore by the existence of a distinct\ntemperature inversion separating the marine boundary layer\n(MBL) from the free troposphere FT. Earlier observations\n(ASTEX, Prospero, Raes, ?) have shown that in he MBL of the\nN.E. Atlantic clean air alternates with anthropogenic pollution\nfrom Europe and possibly from N. America (ASTEX, McGovern, see\ndiscussion below). In the FT aloft, clean air masses alternate\nwith mineral dust transported out of N. Africa (Propspero,\nRaes). The area thus offers opportunities for studying the\ncharacteristics of various aerosol types. Furthermore, the\ndynamics of the MBL in this area are reasonably well understood\n(ASTEX) so that Lagrangian experiments could be planned\nfocusing on aerosol processing during transport over the\nocean. In addition, the area offers good opportunities to study\nthe interaction of aerosol!  s with the low level MBL\nstratiform clouds.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Determine the physical, chemical, radiative and cloud\nnucleating properties of the major aerosol types in the North\nAtlantic region and investigate the relationships between these\nproperties.\n\n2. Quantify the physical and chemical processes controlling the\nevolution of the major aerosol types and in particular their\nphysical, chemical, radiative and cloud nucleating processes.\n\n3.

PAS are very important in nature conservation, especially in preservation of environmental standards and plant and animal gene pools, and in maintenance of ecological balance. PAS are conductive to renewal of natural resources and improve the quality of human environment.\nThe importance of ecological monitoring in the Arctic and Subarctic zones within the framework of the International Polar Year is due to a low level of stability of the Arctic, Subarctic and northern Taiga ecosystems under the pressure of anthropogenic load and, consequently, their high vulnerability.\nComplex ecological research is planned on the territory of the reserves heavily affected by pollution: the Kostomukshskii and the Pasvik state nature reserves. The Kostomukshskii reserve is situated in the north-eastern Karelia, near the border with Finland. In 1990, a Russian-Finnish reserve “Druzhba” (“Friendship”) was founded, represented by the Kostomukshskii reserve on the Russian side and by five isolated PAS on the Finnish side. An ore mining and processing enterprise (OMPE) is situated very close to the reserve, emitting into the atmosphere up to 60-70 thousand tons of pollutants annually, including up to 50 thousand tons of sulphur dioxide. The Pasvik reserve is situated in the Pechanga district of the Murmansk region, in the River Pas catchment area, near the border with Norway. An OMPE “Pechanganikel’” is situated at a distance of 15 kilometres from the reserve, emitting into the atmosphere up to 260 thousand tons of sulphur dioxide, 300 tons of nickel and 230 tons of copper annually.\n\nMain research objectives\nDevelopment and implementation of a program of complex PAS monitoring, for development of rational schemes of nature protection and management in PAS.\nDevelopment and implementation of an IAS on PAS of the Russian Polar Zone on the basis of GIS technologies, for support of management decisions.\nEcological education and increasing public awareness of PAS as a mechanism of wildlife conservation.\n\nResearch stages\nStage 1. Collection of information available in the library stocks and its analytical review.\nStage 2. Creation of a set of basic digital cartographic materials on the territories in question, development and substantiation of information system structure and composition of information resources.\nStage 3. Complex field research at the pilot objects, including eco-geochemical testing and other specialised investigations.\nStage 4. Chemical-analytical investigations.\nStage 5. Office studies of the materials collected and the incoming analytical data. Compilation of the factual information bank.\nStage 6. Development of a programme of complex monitoring (involving climate, eco-geochemical, landscape and biocenological, social and ethnographic factors, economic activity, management, etc.).\nStage 7. Elaboration and implementation of an IAS of PAS, loaded with data on specific objects.\nStage 8.

Ecological theories linking temperature to metabolism, body size and abundance have been successfully applied to many groups of organisms including phytoplankton, with heterotrophic bacteria being frequently left aside. For instance, the growing consensus that bacterial biomass will increase in a warmer ocean likely characterized by lower phytoplankton biomass contradicts the predictions of the metabolic theory of ecology. Unraveling the reasons for this apparent departure underlies the objectives of this project. Both the biodiversity and functioning of pelagic ecosystems will likely be affected by temperature changes.\n\nCOMITE will address the effects of future warming on the ecology and biogeochemical role of temperate coastal microbial assemblages through three different approaches:\n\n1. a retrospective analysis of the linkages between temperature, other environmental drivers and bacterial community structure and size-abundance relationships in a coastal time-series initiated in 2002 off Xixón, Spain (southern Bay of Biscay);\n   \n2. monthly experiments assessing the response of different bacterial groups to ambient temperature plus -3 and +3ºC over a complete annual cycle;\n   \n3. comprehensive evaluation of the temperature-dependence of organic matter fluxes through microbial plankton at four significant oceanographic periods (spring phytoplankton bloom, summer stratification, autumn bloom and winter mixing).\n\nThe final goal of COMITE data analysis is to build a predictive, testable model on the effects of realistic temperature rises on the biogeochemical role of oceanic bacteria. Among other novel approaches, the project will:\n\n1. test for the first time whether enhanced metabolism due to higher temperature will result in lower bacterial biomass;\n    \n2. integrate bacterial phylogenetic and physiological structure within the temperature response as formulated in the metabolic theory of ecology.",

Based upon the long and excellent experiences with different scientific groups performing air monitoring within the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP), an expanded network will be established including all AMAP stations and all major Antarctic 'year-around' research stations. As an integrated project within the 'International Polar Year 2007-08' initiative, the ATMOPOL co-operation intend to:\n\n- Establish a long-term coordinated international Arctic-Antarctic contaminant programme.\n- Develop and implement a joint sampling and monitoring strategy as an official guideline for all participating stations.\n- Support bi-polar international atmospheric research with high-quality data on atmospheric long-range transport of contaminants (sources, pathways and fate).\n- Support future risk assessment of contaminants for Polar Regions based on effects of relevant contamination levels and polar organisms\n\nBased upon the well-established experiences of circum-Arctic atmospheric contaminant monitoring in the Arctic under the AMAP umbrella, a bi-polar atmospheric contaminant network will be established and maintained. In conjunction with the polar network of atmospheric monitoring stations for air pollution, surface-based and satellite instrumentation will be utilised to provide the characterization of the Arctic atmospheric-water-ice cycle. Together with numerical weather prediction and chemical transport model calculations, simultaneous measurements of pollutants at various locations in the Arctic and Antarctic will enhance our understanding of chemical transport and distribution as well as their long-term atmospheric trends. In addition to investigating the importance of atmospheric transport of pollutants an understanding of the transference and impact of these pollutants on both terrestrial and marine environments will be sought. A secretariat and a 'scientific project board' will be established. During this initial phase of the project (2006), a guideline on priority target compounds, sampling strategies, equipment and instrumentation, analytical requirements, as well as quality assurance protocols (including laboratory intercalibration exercises) will be developed and implemented. \n\nThe ATMOPOL initiative aims to address highly relevant environmental change processes and, thus, will strive to answering the following scientific questions:\n- How does climate change influence the atmospheric long-range transport of pollutants?\n- Are environmental scientists able to fill the gaps in international pollution inventories and identification of possible sources for atmospheric pollution in Polar Regions?\n- What are the differences in transport pathways and distribution patterns of various atmospheric pollutants between Arctic and Antarctic environments? Why are there such differences?\n- What is the final fate of atmospherically transported pollutants and how does this impact on the environment and indigenous people?\n\nIn order to understand the underlying atmospheric chemistry of pollution, e.g. atmospheric mercury deposition events, routine surface measurements of UV radiation as well as campaign related measurements of UV radiation profiles will also be included.The project will establish a cooperative network on atmospheric contaminant monitoring in Polar Regions far beyond the IPY 2007/08 period and is, thus, planned as an 'open-end' programme. All produced data will be available for all participating institutions for scientific purposes as basis for joint publications and reports from the ATMOPOL database to be developed.",

Over the last 25 years the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has not only managed the currently exploited species but has also taken a global lead in developing ecosystem-based management methods. Now the recognition that polar regions are undergoing substantial climate change heightens the urgency to understand how exploited marine ecosystems can be sustainably managed in an environment that is both extremely variable and changing.\n \nIn this core program we will study the biomass and production capacity of large marine ecosystems, focusing particularly on the geographic distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill, plankton and nekton, considering a combination of factors such as the interaction between species life cycles, ocean circulation, frontal systems, sea-ice cover, food supply, and concentration of vertebrate predators, such as fish, birds, and marine mammals. We will provide an integrated view of the communities and their functioning within the oceanic ecosystems. This will be done through ecosystem-based surveys to map the biological production at all trophic levels, and by comparing the trophic structure and interactions. Such studies are vital for the development of integrated large-ecosystem models that can be used to manage exploited species in an open ocean pelagic environment. \n\nSome component projects will cover large spatial regions such as the Southwest Atlantic at relatively low resolution while others focus on smaller areas to study in more detail the role of key species within the trophic web and consider the effect of seasonality. Key physical processes within the marine ecosystems will be monitored and modelled to establish the physical framework for exploring the variability of the biological production.\n\nObjectives: Obtain a synoptic circumpolar assessment of the Antarctic marine pelagic resources, their environment, food supply and their main predators. \n\nMajor field program activities:\n- Undertake quasi-synoptic multi-disciplinary hydrographic (CTD) and biological (hydroacousticsand biological sampling) studies from the ice-edge or Antarctic continent northward across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to the Polar Front. These studies will cover key regions of the Southern Ocean and presently include the Southwest and Southeast Atlantic, the Ross and Weddell Seas.\n- Census the large-scale distribution of predators and determine the interaction with prey.\n- Determine the Circumpolar demography and population dynamics of key species\n- Determine interaction of key species with seasonal sea ice in the ice-covered areas of the Weddell and Ross Seas.\n- Determine seasonal variation in pelagic ecosystem\n\nModelling studies: \nThe results from the field program activities will fill existing gaps in the quantitative experimental data available for input to conceptual ecosystem models (148, 397, 130) to explore the production potential of the systems and the effects of different harvesting regime. Development of such models will form a key part of both this Program and also a key link to the modelling work undertaken within the ICED Program (417).\n \nLinkages:\nThe science goals of this Program depend on close integration between physical oceanography (of both continental margin and open ocean environments), biogeochemistry, ecology, sea ice studies and meteorology. In addition to the component projects within the Resources cluster we will also develop cross cluster linkages to ensure full inter-disciplinary integration. The division of IPY EOIs into disciplinary clusters is a necessary but artificial distinction. The science goals of CCAMLR depend on close integration between physical oceanography (of both continental margin and open ocean environments), biogeochemistry, ecology, sea ice studies, meteorology (EoI 16, 83, 109, 193, 417, 577).",

The goals of the Arctic Quest project are to form new connections with international artists and to cultivate vital cultural links between southern Canada's artistic community and Inuit artists at both professional and student levels, and to expose the resulting body of art to the Polar region communities and the international public to increase appreciation and awareness and stimulate interest in the fragile Polar region. \n\nFor the first phase of the project 25 artists from Canada and the United will begin in 2006 with an Arctic voyage celebrating the 100th Anniversary of the first successful navigation of the Northwest Passage by Roald Amundsen. They will follow in the footsteps of famous explorers and great artists that have inspired them. They will paint the landscape, people, flora and fauna and weather as they interpret it. This voyage in Canadian, Greenland (Danish) and International waters, will retrace some of the early explorers and artists original routes, stopping periodically to sketch, paint and photograph what they see. After 12 days at sea, the group will return to their studios and record and develop their experiences in paint.\n\nDuring the second phase of the project the artists will share their artistic interpretations in an extensive series of exhibitions throughout 2007 and 2008, planned to coincide with International Circumpolar Year. The Arctic Quest Exhibition is planned to contain artwork of early explorers, representatives of the Group of Seven (Harris, Varley, and A.Y. Jackson), Doris McCarthy and Maurice Haycock (two artists inspired by the Group of Seven) as well as the works of the 25 contemporary artists, who have been in turn inspired by those who went before. Works of Inuit artists will also be included.\n\nBoth elements of the project are supported by a variety of educational, outreach and legacy initiatives. For example, the Arctic Quest voyage will include art shows of local Inuit talents, invitations of local Inuit artists aboard the vessel, painting workshops with children to develop artistic skills and donations of artist materials to communities visited during the expedition. In addition the project will restore and dedicate the yellow cabin in Pangnirtung built by artist Maurice Haycock in 1926 during a year's surveying assignment with the Geological Survey of Canada. A restoration plan would be developed with the community: some thoughts at this time include a historic site, art library, art store, artist studio, or all of the above. As well, a cairn commemorating the work of Maurice Haycock will be built by a small group of the artists at Alexandra Fiord, Ellesmere Island in close proximity to one built by Dr. Haycock in 1969 in recognition of his friend and painting companion A.Y. Jackson's most northerly painting location in 1927, the year they met. And finally, a documentary film by Janet and John Foster, Gemini Award Winning Film makers, will highlight the artists entire journey with a focus on the historic roots of the expedition, including Amundsen's successful navigation through the Northwest Passage. This documentary will draw attention to the area, the issues related to the arctic such as global warming, sovereignty issues and its sensitive and fragile environment.\n\nThe Arctic Quest Exhibition will travel to communities in Canada, the United States and Norway. Concurrent with the art exhibition, there will be outreach programs, screening of the documentary, art workshops for children, demonstrations of Inuit artistic skills and cultural crafts, and lectures. Inuit painting workshops will be given as part of the Ontario Lieutenant Governor's Twinning Initiative between the North and South. Two book launches will also bring attention to the historic work of the Geological Survey of Canada, plus early settlement by Inuit and exploration by Europeans in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago: Maurice Haycock's Diary of a year in the arctic in 1927, and Historic Sites in the Canadian Arctic.",

The outstanding role of polar regions in the global climate system is currently evidenced by the distinct warming of polar regions (e.g. Arctic realm, Antarctic Peninsula) that exceed modern warming on a global scale. Polar processes and conditions include biological cycling and physical circulation in the polar oceans, the formation and distribution of sea ice, the behavior of permafrost areas, atmospheric circulation and transport of water vapor, and the volume and stability of continental ice. Polar and subpolar High-Nutrient-Low-Chlorophyll (HNLC) areas may act as CO2 sinks during glacial periods when the increased input of the micronutrient, iron, stimulates primary production. The extent and the seasonal variability of sea ice influences the Earth's albedo, water mass production, heat and gas exchange between the ocean and atmosphere, and biological productivity. Melt water pulses, which alter surface ocean density gradients, may induce rapid climate change. The impact of such environmental events in the Arctic Ocean, North Atlantic, and Southern Ocean may propagate globally via ocean circulation, through the operation of the 'bipolar seesaw'. New data suggest a less stable Antarctic ice volume than generally presumed, even during cold periods, and shed new light on the vulnerability of the Antarctic ice sheets and their effect on global ocean circulation and sea level change. What is needed now is determined investigation of these diverse processes so a sophisticated picture of the power of polar regions to drive climate change can be assembled.\n\nThe international and multidisciplinary effort within the proposed BIPOMAC network will generate the coordinated, broad-ranging influx of knowledge necessary to clarify the intertwined roles of bipolar ice, ocean, and atmospheric processes in climate evolution and sea level change at different operational modes of the bipolar climate machinery. This wave of knowledge will come from carefully selected marine and terrestrial records covering the Pliocene to Holocene from both polar regions. This will also include records from areas that have to date been sparsely investigated, if at all (central Arctic Ocean, Arctic Pacific, NE Siberia, Antarctic Pacific, Antarctic ice shelf). The better understanding of the polar systems will substantially increase our ability to forecast future climate and sea level change, and help us focus our responses to the environmental challenges that we will be facing.\n\nThe BIPOMAC network combines: \n\n(1) Process studies to clarify mechanisms of polar sediment deposition and alteration and quantify the impacts on paleoenvironmental proxies. These studies include that of polar land to ocean sediment transfer, sediment and particle fluxes in the polar seas and lakes, and the paleoecological implications of an experiment in the Scotia Sea to test iron addition as a means for CO2 sequestration.\n\n(2) Paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on well-dated northern and southern polar paleoceanographic, paleolimnological, terrestrial fossil, and continental ice volume/extent records. Study intervals and areas include: \n(a) warmer-than-present Pliocene and Pleistocene intervals from the Canadian Arctic (Beaver Pond, Bylot Island), the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean and expected from NE Siberia (El' gygytgyn) and Antarctic near-shore drillsites (ANDRILL); \n(b) Pleistocene glacial/interglacial cycles from shelf/coastal lowland permafrost and lake deposits of NE Siberia (e.g. Lake El´gygytgyn), North Greenland terrestrial records and from Patagonian/South American lake sediments; and marine deposits from the continental margin and deep Arctic Ocean, the Arctic and Subarctic Pacific, Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk, North Atlantic, the Indian, Atlantic (Scotia Sea) and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean including near-shore studies in the areas of Prydz Bay, the Antarctic Peninsula and the Ross Sea (e.g. McMurdo Sound); \n(c) the Late Glacial and Holocene documented in terrestrial, permafrost and/or lake deposits from a large variety of locations in the Canadian and Russian Arctic, NE Siberia and Kamtchatka, on Svalbard, Southern Ocean islands and in Antarctic coastal areas (e.g. Prydz Bay) together with marine deposits from the Arctic continental shelf and margin, the Arctic Pacific, Bering Sea and Sea of Okchotsk, the Indian, Atlantic (Scotia Sea) and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean. \n\n(3) Numerical modeling of ice-atmosphere-ocean processes to decipher the complex pathway and timing of climate development, its internal amplification and propagation mechanisms (ice/ocean/atmosphere), and the effect of external forcing (insolation/solar activity).\n\nThe BIPOMAC network also includes projects for the development of innovative methods for the enhancement of paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on diatom biomarkers and stable isotopes of biogenic opal and associated organic matter, and the increase in the accuracy of dating with the radiocarbon method in polar, low-carbonate sediments.",

The research is organized around three general hypotheses about the mechanisms reeulating adjustments of primary production in response to short- and long-term variation in climate. The basic idea is that different mechanisms control the responses to climate at different levels of ecological organization and at different time scales. In order to obtain useful predictions of the effects of climate change on primary production, a better understanding of relationships between these interacting mechanisms of adjustment to climate change is needed. To test the three general hypotheses, this five-year program of research will focus on an integrated series of field experiments in moist tussock tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska. The mechanisms to be studied include those operating at the physiological level (e.g., photosynthesis), the whole-plant level (storage and recycling, changes in allocation and biomass turnover), the species and ecotype levels (constraints on nutrient use efficiency and growth rates), and the whole-ecosystem level (climate controls on soil nutrient supply). This project is part of International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). It is funded within the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program. Collaboration with other ecologist working at Toolik Lake and at other arctic sites as part of the Long-Term Ecological research (LTER) and Global Change in Terrestrial Ecosystems (GCTE) programs will increase the application and impact of this research.\n\nLogistics Summary:\nThis project will work at Toolik field station with a goal of analyzing the role of temperature, light, and nutrient availability in regulating primary production of arctic tundra ecosystems at several levels of ecological organization and at different time scales.

Northern communities and governments wish to plan for the future by understanding changes and applying tools to manage them in an integrated way. The science of cumulative effects theorizes that ecological, social, and economic conditions respond to increasing doses of human-induced changes in ways that can be measured empirically. Dose-response curves provide a scientific framework to unify change measurement across disciplines. By examining responses along a continuum of landscape change, relationships between ecological, economic and social indicators can be developed. These dose-response curves can then be integrated into landscape models to evaluate trade-offs and identify practical options that optimize social, ecological, and economic outcomes. Such models help empower northern governments, aboriginal groups, and communities to understand and accept trade-offs associated with cumulative effects management. \nWe have gathered a team with expertise and a performance record linking economic, social, and ecological responses to intensity of human development in northern communities. Comparative and integrated Arctic case studies will be conducted in Canada in the Southeast Yukon and Labrador. Ecological dose-response curves will be generated for our case study areas by surveying aquatic (water quality, benthic invertebrate and fish) and terrestrial (bird and mammal) communities along gradients of human activity. Social and economic dose-response curves will be generated using interviews to document community preferences along similar land use change gradients. These data will be used to generate predictive relationships between ecological, social and economic indicators and human activity using common dose-response methodologies. Spatial and aspatial cumulative effects models will be used to conduct informed trade-off analyses to illustrate the benefits and liabilities associated with different northern land use trajectories. Implementation schemes that support desired ecological and socio-economic outcomes and reflect existing structures will be developed. Our Canadian methodology is tied to comparative methodologies used by our international partners in Scandinavia and Russia. Through the European Water Directive, Sweden has committed to the collection of trans polar data using the reference condition approach to understand how aquatic communities respond to arctic development (Dr. RK Johnson, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences). The land use-land cover change project in northern Canada and eastern Russia (ARCTLANDS, Mr. Andrey Petrov EoI 338) will relate historical land use changes to social indicators of community well-being using common methodology, and to biodiversity indicators of ecological sustainability using a similar gradient approach across Scandinavia, eastern Europe and western Russia (Dr. Per Angelstam, Swedish Univ. Agricultural Sciences) . Studies are being undertaken in 70 areas in Finland to understand factors affecting the implementation and social acceptance of laws for conservation of biodiversity across landscapes (Dr. Mikael Hilden, Finnish Environment Institute). Our IPY integrated approach is based upon research we have conducted over the past 2 years under The Working Landscapes: Integrated Ecosystems Management Project of the Northern Ecosystems Initiative (NEI), funded by Environment Canada (see Section 3.1). \nComparative analysis between our Canadian and international case studies will be used to understand the: 1) transferability of information on social and ecological impacts between northern regions; 2) extent to which impacts depend on the institutional and legal setting in which they are experienced; and 3) the relationship between resiliency of social and ecological systems and site context. The impact of management variables (e.g., scale of management area, demographic makeup of communities, duration of impacts) on the effectiveness of management systems will also be evaluated. We will leave a legacy of training on data collection and analyses so that northern communities can track outcomes as development progresses. This legacy will be implemented through Yukon College as well as the proposed NWT Environmental Sciences Centre of Excellence (EoI 697) and Legacy Research and Outreach Centre in the Yukon (EoI 700), and through technology transfer with the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program (Activity No. 133). Results from our project will assist Northern Communities in developing effective regional resource management systems that take advantage of lessons learned elsewhere, while at the same time being responsive to critical site specific variables and features. The integrated framework provides a baseline of information about ecological and human responses to environmental change that can also be used to assess the impacts of climate driven changes on ecosystem variables.",

Observations of the atmospheric surface layer were made from a buoy anchored 100 km seaward of the ice edge, from a ship steaming in the marginal ice zone (MIZ), and from an instrumented tower erected 100 km into the ice pack. During typical off-ice wind conditions the atmospheric surface layer was found to warm and accelerate with passage over the MIZ. Observations of the atmospheric boundary layer made from sondes launched from the ship in the MIZ showed a gradual warming and rising of the mixed layer with off-ice winds. Oceanic profiles of density and temperature conducted from the ship indicated a homogeneous column seaward of the ice edge, a two-level system under the MIZ with a mixed layer of oceanic water lying below a cooler, fresher lens of water beneath the ice and a homogeneous column north of the MIZ. Near-surface current meter profiles conducted from the within-pack station verified the presence of a sub-ice logarithmic boundary layer. Wind tower and current meter measurements generated estimates of air and water drag coefficients for the ice of 3.09 × 10 at 10 m and 14.7 × 10 at 2 m, respectively. The ice floes in the vicinity of the station were tracked for about 2 weeks until they reached the ice edge and melted. Tidal forces were seen to be an important component in the motion of ice floes. Floes were also observed to accelerate as they approached the ice edge.\n\nInformation provided by http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/publications/search_abstract.php?fmContributionNum=617",

            "definition": "The climate of Alaska has changed substantially over the last 100 years for which direct observations are available. For the last 50 years reliable data are available, while before this time calibration of the instrumentation was spotty, and major breaks in the observations have occurred. During the last 50 years the temperature in Alaska increased by some 3°F (Stafford, Wendler and Curtis 2000, Theoretical and Applied Climatology 67, 33-44), which is about 6 times the worldwide rate of about 1°F per century. This increase varied both in place and time, and seasonally, winter showed the largest increase followed by spring. The temperature increase was not steady over the 50 years; in the mid-seventies a strong temperature increase was observed (Hartmann and Wendler 2005, Journal of Climate, in press). Since then the temperature has not increased, with the exception of the North Slope. This strong, sudden temperature increase indicates that it is due to a circulation change, and at least not directly caused by increased greenhouse gases. We plan to further investigate the climate change, not only for mean values, but also for extremes.\nSea ice has decreased in the Southern Beaufort Sea and a good correlation between sea ice concentration and mean annual temperatures of coastal station was observed (Wendler, Moore, Curtis and Stuefer 2002, Proceedings of the 16th IAHR International Symposium, 202-210). This decrease in the sea ice leads to more open water, and during stormy periods, more erosion of the coastline occurs due to more wave action resulting from a longer fetch. There are further some indications that storminess has increased. The increased erosion rate is of great importance for villages at the North and west coast of Alaska, Shishmaref being the most prominent one, but for sure not the only one. We plan to investigate the relationship between temperature, sea ice, storminess and erosion. The surface energy budget for different ice concentration and ice types are proposed to be studied during a cruise in the Arctic Ocean jointly with our Russian colleagues.\nThe observed temperature increase has resulted also in glacier retreat. The mass balance of a glacier is the result of solid precipitation and the melting in summer due to temperatures above the freezing level. Most of the glaciers, and the largest in sice are found in the southern Alaska (Bering and Malaspina Glaciers, Juneau and Harding Ice Fields), where the temperature is much warmer than in the northern Alaska, however, the snow fall is also much higher by a factor of 10. The retreat is especially large in the Brooks Range, where the temperature increase was accompanied by a decrease in precipitation (Curtis Wendler Stone Dutton 1998, International Journal of Climatology 18, 1687-1707). McCall Glacier, studied since the IGY, is a typical example. We propose to investigate the glacier behavior in each of the 3 major mountain ranges as function of the climatic change observed since IGY. There is a good background of selected glaciers since IGY on which our study will concentrate.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=114",

The goal of this creation was the need of a specialized organism to orientate, control, address and perform scientific and technical research and studies concerning this region, in coordination with the Comisión Nacional del Antártico, an institution depending on the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Stations set up at Marguerite Bay, Hope Bay, and Filchner Ice Shelf, and scientific summer seasons were the support for these goals, including a wide range of earth, sea and air sciences. On January the 26th, 1956, the Internal Rules of the Instituto Antártico Argentino are established. These Rules fix the scientific and technical nature of the institution. The Instituto Antártico Argentino becomes a dependency of the Navy Ministry, and doctor Rodolfo N. M. Panzarini (1956-57)(1958-68), Rear-admiral, Doctor on oceanography and Professor at Universidad de Buenos Aires, is designed Director. Since this time, the Instituto Antártico Argentino participated in several international scientific events, as the International Geophysic Year (1957-58) and the International Quiet Sun Year (1964-65). From 1958 to 1963, the Institute managed Ellsworth Station, Weddell Sea, transferred by USA after the International Geophysic Year. In 1964, Brown base, Paradise Bay, was incorporated as a permanent scientific station. In 1970 the Dirección Nacional del Antártico, a dependency of the Ministry of Defense, was created. The new institution had administrative and logistic functions and included the Antarctic Institute as the scientific organism with three departments: Science, Technique, and Scientific Exchange. In this time, twenty-one programmes were performed, including earth sciences, biological sciencies, and atmosphere sciences, in coordination with other national and international institutions. During the 80´s, the old shelter located at Potter cove, 25 de Mayo (King George) island, was incorporated, and became latter Jubany Base, where Dallmann laboratory operates. Dallmann laboratory is the only one in Antarctida to be operated in cooperation between two countries: Germany and Argentina. Research on biological and earth science fields is carried out at this laboratory. In 2003, under the Decree Nº 207/2003 issued by the Executive Power of Argentina, the Dirección Nacional del Antártico and the Instituto Antártico Argentino became a part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Cult. Accordingly to the principles of its creation, the Instituto Antártico Argentino, as a part of Dirección Nacional del Antártico, participates at present, with its scientific, technical and administrative staff, in a wide range of national and international programmes for a better understanding of the Antarctic. \n\nInformation provided by http://www.dna.gov.ar/INGLES/INDEX.HTM",

The USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center and the Canadian Wildlife Service, National Wildlife Research Center jointly coordinate the BBS program. \n\nIn the mid-twentieth century, the success of DDT as a pesticide ushered in a new era of synthetic chemical pest control. As pesticide use grew, concerns, as epitomized by Rachel Carson in Silent Spring, regarding their effects on wildlife began to surface. Local studies had attributed some bird kills to pesticides, but it was unclear how, or if, bird populations were being affected at regional or national levels. Responding to this concern, Chandler Robbins and colleagues at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center developed the North American Breeding Bird Survey to monitor bird populations over large geographic areas.\n\nAlthough most concerns over pesticide use in North America have subsided in recent decades, bird populations continue to be subjected to numerous widespread threats including habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, land-use changes, and other chemical contaminants. Today, the BBS continues to monitor bird populations across North America and informs researchers and wildlife managers of significant changes in bird population levels. If significant declines are detected, their causes can then be identified and appropriate actions taken to reverse them before populations reach critically low levels.\n\nThis summary is taken from http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/BBS/about/",

The NCSCD will aim to incorporate already existing data from poorly represented regions (e.g. Russia), and also from lake sediments and deep ice- and carbon-rich Quaternary deposits. CAPP related research and monitoring carried out by project participants is currently restricted to a limited number of locations. Within this project the participants will contribute to and initiate new research activities at up to 10-12 high latitude transects in the northern hemisphere, complemented by 2 transects in the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic regions, and additional altitudinal transects in high alpine environments. CAPP is therefore linked closely with IPY projects ANTPAS (33), TSP (50) and ACCO-NET (90).\n\nThe allocation of below-ground carbon in the landscape and quantity and quality among different permafrost settings will be investigated through intensive study sites along the transects. The organic matter will be analyzed using a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated geochemical and absolute dating techniques.\n\nAn important objective is to develop a carbon database that can be linked with remote sensing classifications at global to regional scales used in climate, biome and ecosystem models. Gained expert knowledge about soil carbon related processes will be used in process-based dynamic global vegetation models for a more reliable projection of the future terrestrial component of the global carbon balance and for model validation purposes. Results from CAPP will enable climate models to include one of the potentially most significant positive feedbacks in the global climate system. \n\nProtocols are developed for the carbon database, field sampling, physico-chemical analyses and upscaling exercises. CAPP activities will provide better understanding of total below-ground organic matter allocation and its susceptibility to decay. This will be used to evaluate the fate of this very significant carbon pool under global warming. High latitude terrestrial ecosystems are important reservoirs of soil organic matter. There is more carbon in these below-ground pools than in the living phytomass of all forests on Earth together. It is therefore important to communicate to the wider scientific community and general public the potential role of thawing permafrost carbon stocks in the Earth System.",

The research program was conducted for 13 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack. This investigator used the Twin Otter logistics aircraft to conduct surveys of the surface temperature in the vicinity of the ship in order to determine the thin-ice thickness distribution. This research will be important for the determination of the effects of the flux of incoming heat radiating onto the ice floe as a function of changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Ice surface temperature was measured with a narrow-beam radiometer and a video tape record of the surface was recorded during daylight flights. The surveys covered an area within 50 km of the ship. The sea ice temperature measurement program makes an essential contribution to the SHEBA team of researchers who will measure atmospheric variables with a large array of instruments on the ice floe and aircraft flying above as well as ice and ocean property measurements made on and below the ice floe. The combined set of measurements in SHEBA will allow refinement of climate models for the Arctic region. Those improved models will lead to better predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increased above present levels.\n\nLogistics Summary:\n\nFor the Surface Heat Budget of the Oceans (SHEBA) Project, the Canadian Coast Guard Icebreaker Des Groseilliers was frozen into the Beaufort Sea pack ice 300 km north of Prudhoe Bay and left to drift from October 1997 to October 1998. The ship was used as a base of operations and floating scientific research station. During its year in the ice it followed a meandering path and ended up 400 miles north of its point of origin. During the SHEBA campaign, researchers conducted measurements in an approximately 100 square km area around the SHEBA site. Logistics were provided by ONR and U. Washington. This project utilized the Twin Otter logistics support aircraft to conduct surveys of the surface temperature from October 1997 through May 1998 . Nine survey flights were completed on six different campaigns. \n\nThis information is taken from \n\nhttp://www.vecopolar.com/arlss_reports/ARLSS_ProjectsDetail.aspx?cbPropNum=9701514",

ANTLER is a research-network initiative with the aim to provide support, methodological integration, data management, and education and outreach facilities for participating projects. These projects share the same topic yet they may employ different methodologies. \n\nIn addition to the existing scholarship on human-Rangifer relations, IPY 2007-2008 will foster new social-science case studies in many circumpolar regions where reindeer herding and/or caribou hunting take place. ANTLER seeks to unite these efforts, with the aim to assess the current social, socio-economic and cultural significance of reindeer herding and caribou hunting 'on the ground' and to provide reliable and realistic information for future management strategies. ANTLER participants will also compare and evaluate various methodologies in the field of Rangifer research and strategies for improved data management. ANTLER will contribute to a better understanding of an important human-animal relationship in the Arctic: on the one hand, through contributing knowledge concerning the social significance of Rangifer as it shapes human life in the Arctic; on the other hand, through examining the significance of human social, economic and political strategies as they affect Rangifer populations, distribution and its position in the Arctic ecosystem. ANTLER addresses reindeer herding and caribou hunting as important elements in Arctic and sub-Arctic environments and economies. The International Polar Year provides a timely and excellent framework for this international initiative, which will also serve as basis for enhanced multidisciplinary research on Rangifer. \n\nWithin the wider field of research on human-Rangifer systems, ANTLER's main emphasis is on domesticated reindeer and the domain of knowledge produced by social sciences. It thus complements other projects (such as EALAT and CARMA) with their stronger emphasis on other domains of knowledge. \n\nUnder the ANTLER umbrella there are two levels of integration. Firstly, there will be five or more key projects, so-called integrated projects, which serve as flagship activities with a research design tailored in accordance with the ANTLER agenda a priori. Secondly, there will be a number of associated projects, each of them designed in its own manner, which contribute selected data to ANTLER.\n\nA network secretariat will organize three international workshops and provide communication and dissemination facilities.

We will focus mainly on the ocean circulation and climate of the NW Eurasian continental margin. The present climate in the Arctic shows signs of rapid change with decreasing sea ice cover and increasing temperature of the Atlantic Water. The implications of this warming are highly uncertain, as modelling experiments projecting temperatures for the next 100 years show a largescatter at high northern latitudes.\n\nThe project will include the following modules (M): M1 Rapid changes in the Atlantic Water inflow into the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean, M2 Ice sheet/glacier response to warming, M3 Improving ocean temperature and sea-ice proxies; M4 Climate modelling.\n\nM1: Periods in the past during which the climate was instable and reached warmer conditions than today: a) Marine isotope stages (MIS) 12/11; b) MIS 6/5; c) Younger Dryas/Holocene climate optimum, and d) last millennium. Sea Surface Temperature ( SST) will be quantified using a multidisciplinary approach, combining faunal/floral based transfer functions and geochemical tracers. For the Holocene and the last millennium climate will be investigated in marine sediments, lake sediments and ice cores from Svalbard and marine sediments from the SE Greenland and SW to N Iceland margin. Further, archaeological sites in Norway and Svalbard will be investigated to explore the relationship between climate and human settlement and activities. \n\nM2: Implications of climate warming for growth and decay of ice sheets and tide water glaciers, and its effect on ice stream dynamics in the Barents Sea and the Svalbard and SE Greenland margin.\n\nM3: Reconstructions of SST below 5 OC based both on transfer functions and geochemical tracers are subject to large uncertainties. This is partly due to incomplete modern training sets at high latitudes. We aim to improve modern analogue data on planktonic and benthic foraminifera, diatoms, dinocysts, foraminiferal Ca/Mg-ratios and oxygen and carbon isotopes. From the same proxies we will also develop transfer functions for sea ice.\n\nM4: An important motivation for attempting to simulate the climatic conditions of the past is that such experiments provide opportunities for evaluating how models respond to large changes in forcing.\nCombined with high resolution acoustic data, cores will be sampled from high resolution sediment fans off northern and western Spitsbergen, the Spitsbergen fjords (in particular Kongsfjorden) and the Barents/Kara/Laptev Sea margin. Multi-core/box core surface samples >70ON in the NE Atlantic will be sampled. The SE Greenland and SW to N Iceland component will rely on existing seafloor samples. The project will include exchange programs and training courses for PhD students and young researchers.\nThis expression of intent focus on research questions addressed by IGP-PAGES and CLIVAR.",

This keystone species has been an economic and cultural mainstay of nearly every indigenous group in the Arctic. Recent profound changes have been occurring in the North with the potential to jeopardize the relationship forged over countless generations between Rangifer, the land and the people. \n\nIn late 2004 a concerned circumpolar group of social scientists, biologists, ecologists, abiotic specialists, aboriginal leaders, and resource managers met in Vancouver, Canada to launch an organization to track and assess the impacts of the changes that are occurring. This group, the CARMA Network (CircumArctic Rangifer Monitoring and Assessment network www.taiga.net/CARMA ) defined its mission:\n\nTo monitor and assess the impacts of global change on the human/Rangifer system across the Arctic through cooperation, both geographically and across disciplines. \n\nAt present, knowledge of many of the Arctic's significant Rangifer populations is fragmented and the relationship among the peoples dependent upon these populations is largely undocumented. Therefore, the CARMA Network proposes an extensive two-year coordinated program through IPY that will \n1) provide a solid baseline of information on representative Rangifer populations and the human communities dependent upon them\n2) establish an on-going monitoring and assessment network of these systems \n\nTo meet these objectives, the following operating principles are proposed: \n-Keep it simple, relevant to the needs of Arctic residents; keep it transparent\n-Conduct monitoring and assessment using an interdisciplinary approach\n-Include and integrate local/traditional knowledge, industry research, field-based biological studies, and remote sensing research\nFocus initially on wild Rangifer populations and those human communities that use the Rangifer resource\n-Build on existing monitoring and assessment programs\n-Serve as a central depository for historical and current information on indicators \n-Develop and standardized protocols for collecting, documenting, and assembling indicators \n-Provide annual analysis on indicators by region and value-added indicators that all regions can share \n-Use a comparative approach to address research questions and advance common understanding of the Arctic System\n-Serve as a resource for policy makers facing regional decisions related to Human-Rangifer Systems \n\nQuestions to be addressed include (but are not limited to): \n\n-What are the most predictive indicators of change in the resilience of Human-Rangifer Systems? \n-How will the combined heterogeneity of regional climate forces and ecological conditions affect availability and use of wild Rangifer?\n-How do we best measure the cumulative effect of landscape-level human activity, climate change, and management policies on the Human-Rangifer Systems? \n-How may disease and parasites that are affected by climate change potentially affect the health of caribou?\n-What are the key social-ecological thresholds of critical change in these systems?\n-How can these systems be managed to enhance sustainability and adaptive capacity?\n\nWe consider such a project as starting the clock across the North, where information gathering is coordinated and comparable, where protocols are standardized, tested and utilized. At the completion of the IPY period, CARMA will produce a comprehensive comparative analysis of Circumarctic Rangifer populations, which will be the tangible legacy upon which the CARMA Network can proceed into the 21st Century.",

We propose a linked programme of plant and soil process studies, isotope analyses, flux measurements, micro-meteorology, process modelling, and aircraft and satellite observations to improve predictions of the response of the arctic terrestrial biosphere to global change. \nClimate warming is resulting from disruption of the global C cycle. The Arctic is already warming significantly, and warming is expected to be fastest and greatest at high latitudes, 4-7ºC over the next century. However, complex linkages between climate, C cycle, energy balance, and hydrology mean that the details of such changes and the response of arctic ecosystems remain poorly understood. The Arctic governs some critical feedbacks in global change: (i) the release by warming of considerable but poorly quantified C stores from high latitude soils (20-60% of the global soil C pool, (Hobbie et al., 2000)) could accelerate the build-up of atmospheric CO2, (ii) a shift in albedo from vegetation changes and altered snow dynamics may affect the global energy balance, (iii) alterations in river discharge into the Arctic Ocean, due to changes in arctic hydrology, may affect the thermohaline circulation (Peterson et al., 2002). Our proposed research will resolve critical unknowns related to these potential feedbacks in the arctic C, energy and water cycles. To improve our understanding of the C, water and energy cycles, we will:\n· quantify the turnover of soil organic matter (SOM), particularly of contrasting age;\n· quantify the differences in C uptake, respiration and allocation among key arctic vegetation types and their responses to drivers: snow, soil temperature (and freezing) and soil moisture);\n· test whether regional estimates of the C cycle derived from atmospheric sampling by aircraft are consistent with upscaled measurements from the land surface;\n· determine regional budgets of net CH4 emissions and their repose to the hydrological drivers;\n· generate improved estimates of the total C stocks of arctic systems in soils and vegetation, with a detailed estimate of errors;\n· investigate the strength of coupling between land-atmosphere energy exchanges and local snow cover and soil moisture;\n· test the accuracy of snow melt, soil moisture and thaw predictions; and determine how to better represent sub-grid scale hydrological processes in regional and global climate models;\n· determine how the interactions of topography with seasonal changes in hydrology govern the strength of C sources and sinks over the arctic landscape.\nOur approach is based on linking multi-scale measurements with models representing our best current understanding. We will determine C, water and energy fluxes at a range of scales using small chambers, eddy flux towers, and aircraft. We will monitor C allocation and turnover in vegetation and soils using direct sampling, but also isotopic analyses and labelling experiments. We will determine landscape patterns of vegetation C, soil C and moisture, and snow-cover with a mix of field surveys, aircraft and satellite imagery. We will use a mix of simple empirical models, ecophysiological models, C turnover models and a land surface scheme from a climate model. Our multi-scale measurements, extensive surveys and process investigations will help to determine the errors in current model characterisations of the behaviour and state of the Arctic, which are reliant on relatively coarse resolution data on soils and vegetation, and simple descriptions of key processes. Close integration of models with data from the start of the consortium will allow us to modify the fieldwork in the light of identified model-data inconsistencies. We will also attempt some innovative experiments, for instance using aircraft to sample the atmosphere for determination of 14C content, a key indicator of soil C turnover. We will work in Sweden and Finland largely, in close collaboration with IPY project 213, ENVISNAR.",

We will improve the quantitative understanding of key biogeochemical processes (particle flux, ecosystem community structure, lateral advection) and physical processes (overturning circulation, ice cover, mixing) through a combination of observations and models. We will upscale new process understanding to large-scale integrative feedbacks of the ocean carbon cycle to climate change and rising carbon dioxide concentrations. We will quantify the vulnerability of the ocean carbon sources and sinks in a probabilistic sense using cutting edge coupled \nEarth system models under a variety of emission scenarios including climate stabilisation scenarios as required for the 5th IPCC assessment report. The drivers for the vulnerabilities will be identified. The most actual observations of the changing ocean carbon sink will be systematically integrated with the newest ocean carbon models, a coupled land-ocean model, an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, and fully fledged Earth system models through a spectrum of data assimilation methods as well as advanced performance assessment tools. Results will be optimal process descriptions and most realistic error margins for future ocean carbon uptake quantifications with models under the presently available observational evidence. The project will deliver calibrated future evolutions of ocean pH and carbonate saturation as required by the research community on ocean acidification in the EU project EPOCA and further projects in this field. The time history of atmosphere-ocean carbon fluxes past, present and future will be synthesised globally as well as regionally for the transcontinental RECCAP project. Observations and model results will merge into GEOSS/GEO through links with the European coordination action COCOS and will prepare the marine branch of the European Research Infrastructure ICOS. Results of the project will be summarised and forwarded to policy makers working on climate change mitigation through specifically targeted outreach papers.",

It has provided the first global-scale view of the clouds over the entire 2007 Northern Hemisphere season with an unprecedented resolution of 5 km by 5 km and is nearing completion of observations in the Southern Hemisphere season. Despite a significant increase in PMC research in recent years, relatively little is known about the basic physics of these clouds at ”the edge of space” and why they are changing. They have increased in brightness over time, are being seen more often and appear to be occurring at lower latitudes than ever before. The overall goal of the baseline mission is to determine why PMCs form and vary. Since the launch of AIM on April 25, 2007, significant progress has been made in achieving this goal and that progress continues at a rapid rate. The AIM data is of very high quality and has changed our view of PMCs and their environment after only one northern hemisphere (NH) season of observations. The startling similarity between the PMC structure observed by CIPS and that seen in tropospheric clouds suggests that the mesosphere may share some of the same dynamical processes responsible for weather near Earth’s surface. If this similarity holds up in further analysis, it introduces an entirely different view of potential mechanisms responsible for PMC formation and variability. \n\nAIM has provided the most detailed picture of NH clouds ever collected:\n\n- The clouds appear every day, are widespread and are highly variable on hourly to daily time scales.\n- PMC brightness varies over horizontal scales of a few kilometers, and because of the AIM high horizontal resolution, we now know that over small regions the clouds are ten times brighter than measured by previous space-based instruments.\n- A previously suspected, but never before seen, population of very small ice particles was measured that is believed to be responsible for strong radar echoes from the summertime mesosphere.\n- Mesospheric ice occurs in one continuous layer extending from below the main peak at 83 km up to around 90 km.\n- Mesospheric cloud structures, resolved for the first time by the CIPS imager, exhibit complex features present in normal tropospheric clouds.\n\n\nINFORMATION PROVIDED BY http://aim.hamptonu.edu/mission/index.html",

ASTEX was based on two islands and several ships in an area\nwhere the total cloud cover (mostly stratocumulus) ranges from 50 -\n60%. The region is dominated by low-level clouds with moderate optical\nthicknesses, from about 1 to 10 on average. The optically thinner\n(more highly broken) clouds generally have cloud tops below the 800 mb\nlevel). The optically thicker clouds have lower top pressures down to\nabout 700 mb. The region is characterized by broken low cloudiness and\nstrong gradients of low level cloud amount. Satellite studies show\ncloud conditions ranging from solid stratocumulus decks to broken\ntrade cumulus. The region is not directly influenced by continental\neffects, and islands provide suitable sites for surface observations\nand aircraft operations. ASTEX was thus able to address issues related\nto the stratocumulus to trade-cumulus transition and cloud-mode\nselection.\n\nASTEX involved intensive measurements from several platforms and was\ndesigned to study how the transition and mode selection are affected\nby 1) cloud-top entrainment instability, 2) diurnal decoupling and\nclearing due to solar absorption, 3) patchy drizzle and a transition\nto horizontally inhomogeneous clouds through decoupling, 4) mesoscale\nvariability in cloud thickness and associated mesoscale circulations,\nand 5) episodic strong subsidence lowering the inversion below the\nlifting condensation level. From a broader perspective ASTEX was\ndesigned to provide improved dynamical, radiative, and microphysical\nmodels and an improved understanding of the impact of aerosols, cloud\nmicrophysics, and chemistry on large-scale cloud properties.\n\nFrom a broader perspective ASTEX was designed to provide improved\ndynamical, radiative, and microphysical models and an improved\nunderstanding of the impact of aerosols, cloud microphysics, and\nchemistry on large-scale cloud properties.\n\nA telescoping approach was used in ASTEX to investigate connections\nbetween scales ranging from microns to thousands of\nkilometers. Satellites and upper- level aircraft provided a\ndescription of large-scale cloud features, and instrumented aircraft\nflying in the boundary layer and surface- based remote sensing systems\nprovided a description of the mean, turbulence, and mesoscale\nvariability in cloud microphysical properties of boundary layer\nclouds. A major deficiency of the FIRE observations, however, was an\ninadequate definition of the large-scale fields of temperature,\nmoisture, and winds. This deficiency was removed for ASTEX by making 4\n- 8 soundings per day from the surface sites and ships, and including\nmany of these upper-air observations on the Global Telecommunications\nSystem (GTS) for assimilation into the ECMWF and NMC\nanalyses. Furthermore, based on the demonstrated utility of\nsurface-based remote sensing during FIRE (Albrecht et al. 1990), the\nuse of such systems was expanded during ASTEX.\n\n      For more information, link to\n'http://kiwi.atmos.colostate.edu/scm/astex.html'",

            "definition": "Antarctic permafrost forms an integral part of the terrestrial cryosphere, yet information on its distribution, thickness, age, and physical and geochemical properties is highly fragmented and absent for large sectors of the region. At the same time, active layer and permafrost conditions are increasingly recognized to be highly sensitive to climate change. Such changes can create important responses in regional hydrology, ecosystems functioning, landscape stability and human environmental impacts. At the same time Antarctic permafrost and soils archive high resolution long-term (Ma) records of past environmental change and biological activity.\n\nObjectives\nThe combined IPA working group on Antarctic Permafrost and SCAR expert group on Antarctic Soils, Permafrost and Periglacial Environments, in close working relationship with the IUSS cryosols group, have launched the ANTPAS project to address some of the current shortcomings and research needs. The overall aim is to develop an internationally coordinated, web-accessible, database and monitoring system on Antarctic permafrost and soils. Specific objectives are:\n\nA common, web-accessible repository for permafrost and soils data.\n\nThe production of thematic maps on Antarctic permafrost and soils.\n\nA system of boreholes providing data on permafrost and soils properties, records of past environmental change, and recording permafrost responses to climate change.\n\nA well-designed monitoring system recording active layer and periglacial process responses to climate change along selected environmental gradients. \n\nANTPAS is an IPY endorsed activity.\n\nPROJECT URL: http://erth.waikato.ac.nz/antpas/index.shtml",

The first three were devoted to the Sea Air Interaction\nProgram--the BOMEX 'Core Experiment'--within a 500-km by 500-km square\nship array. During the fourth period, the array was extended southward\nto incorporate the Intertropical Convergence Zone.\n\nFollowing the field operations, the Barbados Oceanographic and\nMeteorological Analysis Project (BOMAP) Office was established to\nreduce and process the data that had been collected by ship, aircraft,\nand land-based acquisition system under the operational control of the\nBOMEX Temporary Archive at the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in\nAsheville, N.C., in 1971.\n\nOn July 1,1971, the BOMEX office became the Center for Experiment\nDesign and Data Analysis (CEDDA) and was subsequently transferred from\nNOAA's Environmental Research Laboratories to its Environmental Data\nService. One of the tasks assigned to CEDDA--in addition to its\nparticipation in other field experiments, was to reprocess the BOMEX\ndata. Final validation of the data was undertaken through detailed\nanalysis and application of necessary corrections, a task that was\ncompleted in the fall of 1974, when the BOMEX Permanent Archive was\nestablished at NCDC.\n\nFor more information, link to\n'http://rainbow.ldgo.columbia.edu/data/NASAentries/nasa611.html'",

It is made up of people bound together with the common belief that such diseases must be stamped out in order for true national development to commence.\n\nFormed in 1997, CIBAC has grown into a nationwide organization through the efforts of the idealistic and dedicated men and women who compose it. But the fight against corruption is no easy task, it is for this reason that CIBAC continues its invitation for nationalistic, law-abiding and God-fearing citizens to join its cause and contribute towards ensuring a better future for our country.\n\nCIBAC has continuously faced corruption head on. It is instrumental in the filing of cases against erring officials with the Ombudsman and other courts. It has also joined hands with other civic groups as petitioners in filing cases of plunder, graft and corruption, bribery, violations of the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct for Government Employees, and perjury against known public officials. Primary among these is the impeachment complaint filed against former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada in 2000.\n\nCIBAC has not limited its battle against corruption to the courts though. Since 1998, it has been an active participant in peaceful mass actions and mobilizations to reiterate its stand against all forms of corruption. It also continues to broaden its network of anti-corruption groups and agencies to intensify its campaign against corruption.\n\nAs a party-list member in the House of Representatives, CIBAC has taken a more active legislative stand on issues pertaining to good governance, transparency and honesty in the conduct of operations and management of both the public and private sectors, and promotion of the welfare of the marginalized sectors and interest groups, particularly the youth, women, overseas filipino wokers, rural communities, urban poor and labor. \n\nSummary provided by http://www.cibac.org/content/view/12/30/",

By joining several such images together, land cover can\nbe mapped consistently over huge areas. The satellite-based\napproach provides a realistic opportunity to produce land cover\ninformation for the entire Baltic Sea Drainage Basin. Such\nspatially and thematically detailed, update-able and\ncost-effective data is of interest to many users.\n\nThe BALANS database provides a spatial resolution of 150 metres,\nand provides land cover information in several general, as well\nas in some more detailed classes. Currently, the basic database\nhas been established and a number of products can be derived to\nmeet users' specific needs for given geographical areas, data\nformats (raster or vector), spatial resolution/scale, and\nclassification schemes. A generalised version of the database is\nfreely available, including the land cover classes Artificial\nsurfaces, Forest, Water, Wetlands, Snow/ice and other open\nland. The minimum mapping unit is 10 hectares for water and 25\nhectares for the remaining classes. This demonstration database\ncan be downloaded from the page 'Download demo data', accessible\nvia the listbox in the upper right corner.\n\nThe original database has more detailed classes and a minimum\nmapping unit of 150x150 metres.

One of our objectives was to quantify the interrelationships between the NEE and the energy balance measurements made from different sampling techniques. Qualitative and quantitative intercomparisons revealed that on average the correspondence between the mass and energy fluxes measured by these sampling methods was good despite potential spatial and temporal mismatches in sampling scale. Quantitative comparisons using least squares linear regression analyses with the tower-based measurements of NEE as the independent variable indicate that the chamber- and aircraft-based NEE measurements were generally lower relative to the tower-based measurements (slope=0.760.86). Similarly, tower-aircraft comparisons of latent (Le) and sensible (H) heat exchange indicated that the aircraft-based measurements were lower than the tower-based measurements (slope=0.720.80). Qualitative comparisons, however, indicate that the correspondence among the chamber-, tower-, and aircraft-measured fluxes varied both seasonally and interannually, suggesting the lack of a consistent bias between the sampling techniques. The results suggest that differences observed between the chamber, tower, and aircraft flux measurements were primarily due to the failure to account for the spatial distribution of surface types in the tower and aircraft sampling footprint, problems involved in the comparison of temporal and spatial averages, and temporal (e.g., seasonal and interannual) variance in rates of mass and energy flux for a given point. Other potential sources of variance include the underestimation of nocturnal NEE by the tower-based eddy covariance system, and the periodic occurrence of an elevated CO2 plume in the atmosphere over the Prudhoe Bay oil field. Even with these potential sources of variation, the results reveal that the various methods give comparable estimates of NEE and energy flux within a range of temporal or spatial variability.\n\nThis summary is from http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1998/1998JD200015.shtml",

Deployment began in 2000.  Conceptually, Argo builds\non the existing upper-ocean thermal networks, extending their spatial\nand temporal coverage, depth range and accuracy, and enhancing them\nthrough addition of salinity and velocity measurements.  The name Argo\nis chosen to emphasize the strong complementary relationship of the\nglobal float array with the Jason altimeter mission.  For the first\ntime, the physical state of the upper ocean will be systematically\nmeasured and assimilated in near real-time.\n\nObjectives of Argo fall into several categories.  Argo will provide a\nquantitative description of the evolving state of the upper ocean and\nthe patterns of ocean climate variability, including heat and\nfreshwater storage and transport.  The data will enhance the value of\nthe Jason altimeter through measurement of subsurface vertical\nstructure (T(z), S(z)) and reference velocity, with sufficient\ncoverage and resolution for interpretation of altimetric sea surface\nheight variability.  Argo data will be used for initialization of\nocean and coupled forecast models, data assimilation and dynamical\nmodel testing.  A primary focus of Argo is seasonal to decadal climate\nvariability and predictability, but a wide range of applications for\nhigh-quality global ocean analyses is anticipated.\n\nThe initial design of the Argo network is based on experience from the\npresent observing system, on newly gained knowledge of variability\nfrom the TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter, and on estimated requirements for\nclimate and high-resolution ocean models.  Argo will provide 100,000\nT/S profiles and reference velocity measurements per year from about\n3000 floats distributed over the global oceans at 3-degree spacing.\nFloats will cycle to 2000 m depth every 10 days, with a 4-5 year\nlifetime for individual instruments.  All Argo data will be publicly\navailable in near real-time via the GTS, and in scientifically\nquality-controlled form with a few months delay.  Global coverage\nshould be achieved during the Global Ocean Data Assimilation\nExperiment, which together with CLIVAR and GCOS/GOOS, provide the\nmajor scientific and operational impetus for Argo.  The design\nemphasizes the need to integrate Argo within the overall framework of\nthe global ocean observing system.\n\nInternational planning for Argo, including sampling and technical\nissues, is coordinated by the Argo Science Team.  Nations presently\nhaving Argo plans that include float procurement or production include\nAustralia, Canada, France, Japan, U.K., and U.S.A., plus a European\nUnion proposal.  Combined deployments from these nations are expected\nto exceed 700 floats per year by 2002.  Broad participation in Argo by\nmany nations is anticipated and encouraged either through float\nprocurement, logistical support for float deployment, or through\nanalysis and assimilation of Argo data.\n\nFor more information, link to 'http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/'",

The ARCDIV cluster will establish several reference areas in the Arctic, equipped with permanent long-term and new intense campaign based measurements of physical and biological parameters on various temporal and spatial scales, with the aim to resolve the variability of climate and biological diversity on landscape and regional scales around the Arctic. These new observations will be held against data from long-term climate monitoring and experimentally manipulated plots. This is a new frontier for climate change and ecosystem interaction studies aiming at understanding small-scale physical and biological variability in time and space and their links to the large-scale regional climate variability and trend patterns with relation to global climate change.\n\nScientific Content: Multidisciplinary research groups will set up coordinated and intense atmospheric/terrestrial measurement systems and field observations at the different reference sites, integrating the following scientific themes and activities on the basis of variable geometry:\n\n· Physical observations: Meteorological synoptic and automatic weather stations, micrometeorological measurements, radiosondes, UAV and sodar profiling of the ABL, atmospheric radiation including UV, surface radiation budget, regional spectral albedo on land and sea ice, surface energy balance, snow/ice distribution, hydrology, geochemistry, wetland methane fluxes, arrays of temperature loggers and freeze-thawing events.\n\n· Biological observations: Vegetation monitoring and mapping, cryobiology, alpha/beta and genetic diversity, nutrient and carbon cycling/sequestration, microbial communities in soil and freshwater, trophic interactions and structure, predator-prey systems, herbivory, stress parameters, structure and function of ecosystems and colonization.\n\n· Models/Integration: Physical, atmospheric circulation, landscape and radiation transfer models will be used together with the intense physical observations to describe the local abiotic environmental variability and its relation to the regional atmospheric circulation. GIS-systems will assist sampling and integrated analysis of the physical and biological parameters. Remote sensing will be used for extraction of physical and biological parameters at the reference sites. Multi-scale statistical methods will be used for integrated analysis, including the possible projection of future changes.\n\n-Cluster components: This multidisciplinary initiative cluster a coherent set of EOI's for the purpose of coordinating the many complementary research groups of different disciplines and nationalities that are active at various sites/stations in the Arctic, studying different aspects of climate and biological diversity. The added value for all partners is to get access to data relevant for own studies and the total integration of physical and biological knowledge in order to address the complex interaction mechanisms between abiotic and biotic parameters involving small and regional scales.",

The ACE-Asia region includes many types of aerosol particles of widely varying composition and size derived from one of the largest aerosol source regions on Earth.

Air pollution changes dust aerosols in many ways, adding black carbon, toxic materials, and acidic gases to the mineral particles. Atmospheric chemistry and its impact on air quality and climate change are truly global issues. \n  \nWe can not measure dust in one region and assume that dust everywhere around the Earth has the same impact on climate. The dust that is transported from East Asia to the Pacific does not absorb as much light as the dark aerosol from South Asia or some previous measurements of dust from the Sahara Desert. There are dramatic regional differences in the chemical and optical properties of aerosols. \n  \nCombining ACE-Asia suborbital and satellite measurements yields monthly average (April 2001) cloud-free aerosol radiative forcing at the surface exceeding -30 W m-2 in a plume covering the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, Sea of Japan and region downwind of Japan. \n\nThis summary is from http://saga.pmel.noaa.gov/Field/aceasia/ACEAsiaDescription.html",

            "definition": "The polar atmosphere is often considered both pristine and simple. However, there is a strong dynamic between the lower atmosphere and ice surfaces. Over the polar plateau, production in the snowpack controls the chemistry of the lower atmosphere. Halogen chemistry over the sea ice zone depletes boundary layer ozone, and causes mercury deposition. Persistent organic compounds undergo a distillation which leads to their deposition in polar regions. Biochemical processes in open leads play a major role in formation of cloud condensation (CCN) and ice forming nuclei (IFN), and through cloud formation this process may play a vital role in ice-albedo climate feedbacks.\nThe IGBP projects, IGAC and SOLAS, have jointly endorsed a task, “Air-Ice Chemical Interactions”, to determine the importance of these processes, and assess how they would alter with a warming climate and shrinking cryosphere. IPY offers a unique opportunity to determine the spatio-temporal pattern of chemistry and processes from the ice surface through the boundary layer, including cloud formation, by linking various field activities carried out in the same year. AICI-IPY will provide an overall framework, arrange supporting laboratory and modelling studies and integration of remote sensing data, and organise synthesis meetings. This work will support and link these more focussed field activities:\nPolar plateau intensives: studying the influence of the snowpack, and boundary layer structure, by measuring concentrations, fluxes and processes at sites with different characteristics. Summit, Greenland has a long pedigree in air-snow studies, and this will be extended under AICI-IPY. The ANTCI group at South Pole expect to carry out further campaigns in IPY. AICI-IPY scientists will aim to add activities at Concordia (Antarctica).\nThe Arctic Summer Cloud-Ocean Study (ASCOS) will focus on the processes that control boundary layer clouds north of 80ºN, looking at CCN, IFN, and investigating marine biochemical and boundary layer meteorological processes that control their numbers. ASCOS expects to use the Swedish icebreaker, drifting from North Pole during summer 2007, and this will provide opportunities for synergy with other parts of AICI and related projects.\nIn the sea ice zone, both Arctic and Antarctic studies of gas phase chemistry are planned. The Arctic studies will mainly be hosted by the related project, OASIS (Ocean-Air-Sea Ice-Snow Interactions – EoI 344). OASIS contains ambitions both wider (biogeochemistry) and narrower (Arctic ocean/coast) than AICI, and will submit a separate detailed plan to IPY. POLARCAT (EoI 244) will provide some vertical context in the Arctic through aircraft campaign. Counterpart Antarctic coastal studies are already planned in Dronning Maud Land.\nTo provide an overall context for the intensive campaigns, AICI-IPY will determine the year-round spatial distribution of at least that most important molecule, ozone, in the boundary layer. No picture exists of the scale of ozone production and depletion, and its concentration in the boundary layer is not amenable to satellite observations. This work will link other AICI studies, using sensors deployed on autonomous platforms and buoys. AICI will coordinate individual polar operators to fill gaps on the map in the Antarctic and over Arctic land, while OASIS will cover parts of the Arctic Ocean.\n\nInformation provided http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=20",

This project is anchored in the existing Health Canada radiological monitoring network operated throughout Canada. The network includes seven Arctic sites equipped with high volume samplers for airborne particulates. Two of these sites are also equipped for noble gas collection and one site is equipped with a continuous gamma radiation monitor. In addition to the primary functions of supporting of the Canadian Federal Nuclear Emergency Plan and the international Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the network provides regular measurements of a wide range of naturally-occurring radionuclide concentrations in air. Heavy metals and some organic compounds will also be measured in airborne particulates collected by the air samplers. An archive of air filters extending back to the early 1970s will allow the elucidation of time trends in these contaminants. The Health Canada air monitoring network covers an area extending from 55o to 83o North Latitude and 60o to 135o West Longitude, representing a large fraction of the entire land mass in the North polar region. \n\nData from the Canadian network will supplemented with similar data collected by collaborators in other countries notably Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Germany. Ground-based sample collections will also be carried out in the Canadian north to gain a better understanding of the deposition of atmospheric contaminants and their movement through food chains leading to humans.\n\nThe objectives of this project are:\n-Establish an international database for sharing data between monitoring networks in collaborating countries.\n-Develop and extend atmospheric transport models to trace the movement of radionuclides and other contaminants from sources in temperate zones to remote Arctic locations\n-Demonstrate changing trends in atmospheric circulation to the Arctic and within the Arctic by using these contaminants as tracers of atmospheric processes. \n-Document changes in soil gas emanation due to changing permafrost conditions.\n-Examine the link between climate change and forest fires in the north\n-Contribute to an understanding of ozone depletion in the stratosphere and ozone chemistry at ground level.\n-Assess the impact of these changes on the movement of contaminants through Arctic ecosystems and particularly in food chains leading to humans.\n\nThe following ongoing and future studies will be carried out with the aid of air monitoring networks for radionuclides and other contaminants:\n-A study carried out in collaboration with Meteorological Services of Canada has traced the movement of iodine-129 from nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities in Siberia to remote locations in the Canadian Arctic. \n-Radioxenon from the reactor belt in eastern North America has been traced to Yellowknife, NWT. Measurements will be extended to include the long-lived krypton-85, a waste product from nuclear fuel reprocessing, in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions.\n-Cesium-137 released from wood-burning in distant forest fires has been detected at the Yellowknife location. Levoglucosan, a combustion product from forest fires, will also be measured on archived air filters to provide an historical record of forest fire effects. \n-Measurements of uranium, radium, lead-210, and potassium-40, and total dust loading will give information on intercontinental dust transport.\n-The short-lived radon and thoron decay products (lead-212, bismuth-214) are indicative of local emanations of soil gas and will be used to study changing permafrost conditions. \n-The beryllium isotopes (Be-7 and Be-10) are produced by cosmic irradiation of air molecules in the stratosphere. Their abundances and ratios at the earth's surface give information on exchanges of air masses between the stratosphere and troposphere, which are vulnerable to changing climate conditions.\n-Measurements of heavy metals (e.g., Hg, Cd) and selected organic compounds will extend the range of sources and pathways that can be studied and will aid in the understanding of atmospheric chemistry processes in the Arctic. \n\nDetails are still being worked out on the ground based studies.

However, there is a strong dynamic between the lower atmosphere and ice surfaces. Over the polar plateau, production in the snowpack controls the chemistry of the lower atmosphere. Halogen chemistry over the sea ice zone depletes boundary layer ozone, and causes mercury deposition. Persistent organic compounds undergo a distillation which leads to their deposition in polar regions. Biochemical processes in open leads play a major role in formation of cloud condensation (CCN) and ice forming nuclei (IFN), and through cloud formation this process may play a vital role in ice-albedo climate feedbacks.\n\nThe IGBP projects, IGAC and SOLAS, have jointly endorsed a task, Air-Ice Chemical Interactions, to determine the importance of these processes, and assess how they would alter with a warming climate and shrinking cryosphere. \n\nIPY offers a unique opportunity to determine the spatio-temporal pattern of chemistry and processes from the ice surface through the boundary layer, including cloud formation, by linking various field activities carried out in the same year. AICI-IPY will provide an overall framework, arrange supporting laboratory and modeling studies and integration of remote sensing data, and organise synthesis meetings. This work will support and link these more focused field activities:\n\nPolar plateau intensives: studying the influence of the snowpack, and boundary layer structure, by measuring concentrations, fluxes and processes at sites with different characteristics. Summit, Greenland has a long pedigree in air-snow studies, and this will be extended under AICI-IPY. The ANTCI group at South Pole expect to carry out further campaigns in IPY. AICI-IPY scientists will aim to add activities at Concordia (Antarctica).  The Arctic Summer Cloud-Ocean Study (ASCOS) will focus on the processes that control boundary layer clouds north of 80ºN, looking at CCN, IFN, and investigating marine biochemical and boundary layer meteorological processes that control their numbers. ASCOS expects to use the Swedish icebreaker, drifting from North Pole during summer 2007, and this will provide opportunities for synergy with other parts of AICI and related projects.\n\nIn the sea ice zone, both Arctic and Antarctic studies of gas phase chemistry are planned. The Arctic studies will mainly be hosted by the related project, OASIS (Ocean-Air-Sea Ice-Snow Interactions  EoI 344). OASIS contains ambitions both wider (biogeochemistry) and narrower (Arctic ocean/coast) than AICI, and will submit a separate detailed plan to IPY. POLARCAT (EoI 244) will provide some vertical context in the Arctic through aircraft campaign. Counterpart Antarctic coastal studies are already planned in Dronning Maud Land.\n\nTo provide an overall context for the intensive campaigns, AICI-IPY will determine the year-round spatial distribution of at least that most important molecule, ozone, in the boundary layer. No picture exists of the scale of ozone production and depletion, and its concentration in the boundary layer is not amenable to satellite observations. This work will link other AICI studies, using sensors deployed on autonomous platforms and buoys. AICI will coordinate individual polar operators to fill gaps on the map in the Antarctic and over Arctic land, while OASIS will cover parts of the Arctic Ocean.",

            "definition": "Sea ice thickness, combined with areal extent as the sea ice mass balance, is the principal response of climatic and oceanic interaction in the marine areas of Antarctica. A major thrust of the project is to obtain sea ice thickness, extent, and physical properties in order to characterize mechanisms of growth and decay and the roles of both the ocean and atmosphere in the sea ice annual cycle. Ice thickness data will be obtained by a variety of methods including visual and automatic camera ice observations from vessels, buoy arrays, airborne EM surveys, underice draft surveys using Autosub AUVs, satellite remote sensing and moored Upward Looking Sonar arrays. Establishment of a quantitative base for circumpolar ice thickness will allow for comparison to the ASPeCt ice thickness distribution derived from ship observations in the past and for future determinations of the thickness distribution that will be available from validated satellite altimetric observations. The Antarctic sea ice cover can then be quantitatively evaluated for response to global climate change in the future and these measurements, as the ice thickness baseline, will be a legacy of IPY. Comparisons of altimetric derived ice thicknesses with prior ship observations will provide ice thickness variability for a thirty year record in selected areas providing some possibility of interdecadal variability determination in sea ice thickness for the recent past as well. A new project from Finland, (S1FL), will contribute to the overall program by investigations of Sea Ice Mechanics and Modeling.\nFor the fast ice, a network of coastal stations, the Antarctic Fast Ice Network (277), is being established. As with the drifting pack, the response of the fast ice to changes in climate and oceanic influence will be monitored and understood with an array of stations to evaluate regional influences. Because of the access from the manned stations, a wider variety of through ice measurements and detailed structural analyses can be made on a year-round basis than for the drifting pack giving more detailed information. A variety of remote sensing data will also be used to map and characterize fast ice and ground stations will be used to provide validation for remote sensing.\nRemote sensing is a direct component of the lead project (270), to validate satellite altimetric measurements of Antarctic sea ice thickness. Two other projects are primarily remote sensing projects: Multi-frequency, multi-polarization helicopter-borne scatterometer measurements of sea ice radar backscatter'.(308), and a new project from Malaysia, (S2Malay), Polar Ice Monitoring and Parameter Retrieval with Microwave Remote Sensing. One focus of the first project will be on the investigation of the multi-frequency backscattering properties of thin ice, including an attempt to derive its thickness from these measurements and to map frost flowers. S2Malay will perform theoretical modelling and conduct its ground truth measurements on thick fast ice in association with the Antarctic Fast Ice Network(277).\nIn collaboration with the field work, modelling and remote sensing associated with ice thickness and physical properties measurements (9 eoi’s), three projects coordinated by BASICS(862) will conduct year-round studies of Antarctic sea ice physics, biogeochemistry and biology on drifting pack ice and fast ice to better understand and budget exchanges of energy and matter across ocean-sea ice-atmosphere interfaces. BASICS will quantify their potential impact on fluxes of climatically important gases (CO2, DMS) and carbon export to the deep ocean; the Study of Antarctic Sea Ice Ecosystems(818) will focus on the biology within sea ice and relationship to ice physical properties; while Carbon in Sea Ice (976) will provide coordination between the Antarctic and Arctic efforts to understand how sea ice biogeochemistry controls CO2 fluxes.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=141",

The goal was to understand the Ocean-Atmosphere interaction particularly over the mesoscale ocean eddies in that region. The saildrones were equipped with a suite of instruments that included a CTD, IR pyrometer, fluorometer, dissolved oxygen sensor, anemometer, barometer, and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). Additionally, four temperature data loggers were positioned vertically along hull to provide further information on thermal variability near the ocean surface.

Some of these environmental changes, for example climate warming, levels of UV-B radiation, and habitat fragmentation, are projected to continue leading to impacts on the lands of the Nordic countries unprecedented since deglaciation some 10,000 year ago. \n\nThere will likely be large impacts on the peoples of the North, both problems and opportunities, and consequences outside the region because of the important role that the Arctic plays in the earth system: changes in treeline and snow and ice cover affect the transfer of energy and water between land and atmosphere; changes in vegetation, soils and permafrost affect the atmospheric composition of greenhouse gases; millions of birds that breed and feed in the Arctic are important winter components of the biodiversity of European countries further south. Although some arctic Nordic observatories such as the Abisko Station have monitored the environment for nearly 100 years, and much research has been initiated within the last decade, our baseline information on multiple and often interacting environmental changes is still weak and our ability to project impacts of future environmental changes on ecosystems and the land surface at the landscape scale is poor. However, it is the landscape scale of changes that is relevant to people. \n\nAims\nA new collaborative, co-ordinated programme is required to:\n-provide a standardised, georeferenced baseline of environmental information, including statistics and processes, against which changes throughout the current century can be measured, \n-develop models of climate, land use, biodiversity and ecosystem function that can be inter-linked and applied to landscape level projections\n-establish standardised monitoring that can detect change at multiple local sites and that can validate model projections and remotely sensed data.\n\nStrategy \nAn &expedition& to northernmost Sweden will be arranged in which international scientists will be offered logistic support to join Abisko researchers working in the field. The research will be focused on large scale land-freshwater-atmospheric exchange studies at the catchment scale, and will include scientists from several natural science disciplines (such as plant ecology, bio-geochemistry, hydrology, biodiversity, GIS, remote science, meteorology etc). The bio-geo modelling community will be involved, particularly for upscaling. \n\nThe local Swedish indigenous people, the Saami , will be invited to host members of the indigenous peoples from around the Arctic to discuss and initiate collaboration on environmental issues and monitoring.\n\nJoint meetings of the scientists working in the field, computer modellers and indigenous peoples will be arranged for cross-fertilisation and collaboration on environmental process understanding, monitoring and assessment, and projection of environmental change and its impacts.",

            "definition": "The rates at which gases exchange between the oceans and the atmosphere are extremely important to global biogeochemical cycles and to predicting and modelling future climate change, but quantifying them accurately currently remains elusive. Some important issues requiring accurate such estimates include the rate at which anthropogenic carbon dioxide can be taken up by the oceans, quantifying the marine sources of other important atmospheric greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide, and investigating the roles of other marine derived atmospheric gases in a range of climate and atmospheric chemistry related issues. Although advances have been made in our understanding of the gas exchange process in recent years, these advances are still not sufficient to enable us to understand and predict the effects of the major controlling processes. A major problem in the past has been that individual controlling processes have tended to be addressed in isolation, although it is clear that they are all interconnected. What is now required in order to build on past advances is a fully integrated study of the problem using a variety of state-of-the-art techniques. We will achieve this aim by bringing together for the first time, a team of UK experts with diverse interests and expertise within the field of air-sea gas exchange, but with the common goal of understanding these processes more fully. The UK SOLAS directed programme is an ideal framework within which to do this. We plan to participate in two research cruises in the North Atlantic Ocean, during which we will make a variety of key measurements and observations (measure seastate, whitecapping and wave breaking, evaluate the role of bubbles and surfactants in gas transfer, and employ a combination of direct gas flux measurement techniques for CO2, DMS, halocarbons and other gases), supported by a suite of ancillary water column and meteorological data. Our overarching strategy is to constrain these various measurements within an experiment in which we will release gaseous tracers to the water column. By measuring the rates at which these tracers escape to air we will derive important information on gas exchange rates that will provide a framework for interpreting our other measurements. Our cruises will be timed to coincide with times of maximum air-sea exchange fluxes of climatically relevant trace gases. During one of these we will release a natural surfactant along with the gaseous tracers, in order tto investigate the role of surface organic slicks, which are known to suppress air-sea gas exchange. We also anticipate the participation of a number of US-based groups with aims and measurement capabilities complimentary to our own, which will bring 'added value' to the programme. However these are conditional upon external funding from NSF and other US government funding agencies.\n\nSummary provided by: http://gotw.nerc.ac.uk/list_full.asp?pcode=NE%2FC001702%2F1",

To provide accurate projections on the impact of\nclimate warming on these ecosystems requires improved knowledge of its\ncomponents and their linkages. Because of the complexity of the\ninteractions, accurate predictions of what will happen to individual\nspecies requires knowledge on key life-history traits and of what will\nhappen to the ecosystem as a whole, as species do not function\nseparately from their ecosystem. ESSAR, therefore, encompasses\nretrospective and field studies on physics, plankton, benthos, fish\nand shellfish, marine mammals, sea birds and humans. The field studies\nwill be carried out in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans during\n2007-2008. The data gathered will be used, together with bio-physical\nmodels, to make quantifiable predictions of the effects of both\nclimate variability and long-term climate change on arctic polar\nmarine ecosystems.\n\nTo understand the effects of climate variability and change on marine\necosystems we first must document what changes have occurred in the\nphysical oceanography, as well as understand the driving forces behind\nthem. ESSAR will therefore assemble historical data on the physical\noceanography and collect new data to fill in critical gaps in our\nknowledge, such as moored current measurements in the Davis\nStrait-Hudson Strait-Labrador Shelf region and in the northern Barents\nSea between Svalbard and Franz Josef Land. With recent reductions in\nsea ice and predictions of much greater reductions, ESSAR will address\nthe effects of changes in sea ice on various parts of the\necosystem. Results from past and present studies will be assembled to\ndocument distributional shifts of several marine species from plankton\nto marine mammals and seabirds. Also, new field studies in the\nSubarctic of both the Pacific and Atlantic, and in the Arctic, will\nexamine the relationship between thermal heating of the waters and\nchanges in ice coverage, including various feedback\nmechanisms. Nutrient, chlorophyll, ice algae, chemical tracers,\nphytoplankton and zooplankton measurements will determine the effect\nof ice decline on biological processes. An important change following\nthe reduction in ice will be an increase in light levels. Detailed\nstudies of the role of light levels on primary and secondary\nproduction along the latitudinal gradients from 45°N to near the pole\nwill determine how light levels and day duration modify ecosystem\nfunction. The effects of water mass transformations on plankton\nproduction will be compared and contrasted with the effects of sea ice\nand light to determine their relative importance. Our understanding of\nthe sources and variability in zooplankton and their role in the food\nchain varies regionally. Data are relatively scarce in the Labrador\nSea, therefore, under ESSAR, concentrated zooplankton studies,\nespecially on Calanus finmarchicus, will be carried out.  Field-based\nstudies will also focus on the effects of the physical variability on\nthe energy flow through Arctic and Subarctic marine food webs from\nplankton through fish to marine mammals and seabirds, e.g. in the\nBarents Sea, the Norwegian Sea, Lancaster Sound and Hudson Bay. From\nthe human perspective, certain marine species are more important than\nothers because of their commercial or subsistence values. The physical\nenvironment also influences these species, but our understanding of\nthe mechanisms is limited. One of the most important commercial\nspecies in the Northwest Atlantic is shrimp (Pandulus borealis). As\npart of ESSAR, there will be studies of the role of physical\noceanography and biological production cycles in recruitment,\nabundance and distribution of shrimp in Davis Strait, off West\nGreenland, on the Labrador Shelf and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. At\nthe upper ends of the food web, marine mammals and seabirds will be\naffected by changes in the lower ends. Studies will determine the role\nof changes in sea ice and warming waters on marine mammal fitness,\nincluding whales, walruses, seals and polar bears. Seabirds respond\nrelatively quickly to changes in their prey and often can be monitored\nrelatively easily compared to their prey in the marine\nenvironment. ESSAR, through the Circumpolar Seabird Group (CBird) and\nthe members of Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF), will\nmonitor how changes in productivity of Arctic and Sub-Arctic seas\naffect circumpolar seabird populations. Seabird diet studies also will\nbe carried out and compared to similar studies conducted in the 1970s\nand 1980s as a means of detecting if and how the marine ecosystem has\nchanged. As well, detailed studies in the smaller region of Svalbard\nwill be carried out to investigate the changes in seabird community\nstructure as a function of temperature and zooplankton. The effects of\nthese changes to the bird community on the terrestrial ecosystem\nthrough the guano deposited back on land will also be part of this\nstudy. Finally, comparisons between the various geographic regions to\nprovide additional insights will be an important component of ESSAR.",

This will be achieved by supporting a global web of partners to develop funding, capacity and technology transfer to achieve shared, strategic amphibian conservation goals.\nHow the ASG was formed\n\nIn September 2005 in Washington, DC, a Summit was convened by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and Conservation International to bring together the world leaders in amphibian conservation. The purpose: to devise a global strategy of action to arrest amphibian declines and extinctions. The Summit produced a declaration (PDF) and a more comprehensive Amphibian Conservation Action Plan (ACAP) will be published in early 2007. Because of the scale of response required to tackle the current amphibian crisis, the decision was made to merge the Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force (DAPTF), the Global Amphibian Specialist Group (GASG) and the Global Amphibian Assessment into a unified body devoted to Global amphibian conservation: The IUCN/SSC Amphibian Specialist Group (ASG).\n\nThe ASG takes IUCN's Specialist Group model to the next level of effectiveness through the establishment of a Secretariat and that will serve as dynamic hub to coordinate Regional centers and a global web of stakeholders and to leverage the intellectual, institutional, and financial capacity towards shared, strategic amphibian conservation goals.\n\nSummary provided by http://www.amphibians.org./",

It consists of a science component and a\ndata system supporting a coordinated series of polar-orbiting and low\ninclination satellites for long-term global observations of the land\nsurface, biosphere, solid Earth, atmosphere, and oceans. By enabling\nimproved understanding of the Earth as an integrated system, the EOS\nprogram has benefits for us all. The EOS Project Science Office\n(EOSPSO) is committed to helping bring program information and\nresources to program scientists and the general public alike.\n\nEOS Program Description:\n\nSince its creation in 1958, NASA has been studying the Earth and its\nchanging environment by observing the atmosphere, oceans, land, ice,\nand snow, and their influence on climate and weather. We now realize\nthat the key to gaining a better understanding of the global\nenvironment is exploring how the Earth's systems of air, land, water,\nand life interact with each other. This approach -- called Earth\nSystem Science -- blends together fields like meteorology,\noceanography, biology, and atmospheric science.\n\nIn 1991, NASA launched a more comprehensive program to study the Earth\nas an environmental system, now called the Earth Science\nEnterprise. By using satellites and other tools to intensively study\nthe Earth, we hope to expand our understanding of how natural\nprocesses affect us, and how we might be affecting them. Such studies\nwill yield improved weather forecasts, tools for managing agriculture\nand forests, information for fishermen and local planners, and,\neventually, the ability to predict how the climate will change in the\nfuture.\n\nThe Earth Science Enterprise has three main components: a series of\nEarth-observing satellites, an advanced data system, and teams of\nscientists who will study the data. Key areas of study include clouds;\nwater and energy cycles; oceans; chemistry of the atmosphere; land\nsurface; water and ecosystem processes; glaciers and polar ice sheets;\nand the solid Earth.\n\nPhase I of the Earth Science Enterprise had been comprised of focused,\nfree-flying satellites, Space Shuttle missions, and various airborne\nand ground-based studies. Phase II began in December of 1999 with the\nlaunch of the first Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite, Terra\n(formerly AM-1) and Landsat 7. EOS is the first observing system to\noffer integrated measurements of the Earth's processes. It consists of\na science component and a data system supporting a coordinated series\nof polar-orbiting and low-inclination satellites for long-term global\nobservations of the land surface, biosphere, solid Earth, atmosphere,\nand oceans. We have initiated an era of unprecedented observational\ncapability for understanding the planet.\n\nJust as the first weather and communications satellites fundamentally\nchanged our way of thinking about those fields, so the elements of the\nEarth Science Enterprise will expand our perspective of the global\nenvironment and climate. Working together with our partners around the\nworld, we are well on our way to improving our knowledge of the Earth\nand using that knowledge to the benefit of all humanity.\n\nFor more information, link to the EOS homepage at\n'http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/'",

            "definition": "The Biospheric Sciences Branch (formerly Earth Resources Branch)\nwithin the Laboratory for Terrestrial Physics at NASA's Goddard Space\nFlight Center and associated University investigators are involved in\na research program entitled Forest Ecosystem Dynamics (FED) which is\nfundamentally concerned with vegetation change of forest ecosystems at\nlocal to regional spatial scales (100 to 10,000 meters) and temporal\nscales ranging from monthly to decadal periods (10 to 100 years). The\nnature and extent of the impacts of these changes, as well as the\nfeedbacks to global climate, may be addressed through modeling the\ninteractions of the vegetation, soil, and energy components of the\nboreal ecosystem.\n\nThe FED ecosystem modeling research efforts concentrate on the North\nAmerican boreal and northern hardwood transition forests with\nemphasis on optical and radar remote sensing technology. This\nresearch employs an integrated approach of field and aircraft\nstudies, theoretical modeling, and satellite image data processing to\ninfer where landscape pattern and process ecosystem model predictions\nsucceed or fail at regional spatial scales and interannual temporal\nscales. We are also using remote sensing observations as a check on\npotentially observable forest ecosystem model predicted attributes\n(e.g., species composition, tree height distributions, land use\npatterns). Conversely, we are investigating the potential of remote\nsensing observations for extracting biophysical properties of forest\ncanopies, soils, and hydrologic parameters used in our forest\necosystem models. On-going work, in addition to activities discussed\nhere, include modeling, measurement, and data compilation or a number of\nboreal zone sites.\n\nThe FED model framework (see Levine et al., 1983) integrates existing\nmodels of forest growth and succession (i.e., FORET model of Shugart\nand West, 1984 and ZELIG Model of Smith and Urban, 1988), soil\nprocesses (Residue model of Bidlake et al., 1992; Bristow, et al.,\n1986; TERRA model of Levine, 1984; Levine and Ciolkosz, 1988), and\nenergy dynamics (e.g., Smith et. al., 1981; Kimes and Kirchner,\n1982). Each of the models interact with the others to provide feedback\ncontrols on growth, soil related processes, and energy internal and\nexternal to the forest environment. The forest succession and soil\nprocess models require input at the species and soil characteristics\nlevel, respectively. This makes this formulation useful for examining\nthe effects of changes in climate or anthropogenic factors on the\ncommunity composition and structure of the boreal forest.\n\nThe results anticipated from this experiment will enable development\nand validation of the integrated model to usefully characterize the\necosystem dynamics of the boreal forest under a variety of\nconditions. A number of questions pertinent to the combined\nexperiment may then be considered. For example, how do climatic\ngradients determine the spatial distribution of species within the\nboreal forest? What are the possible effects of global climate change\non the boreal forest? Is the boreal forest a net source or sink of\ncarbon and methane and will the present state change if climate\nchanges? Also relevant to the issue of global change are the\nmagnitudes of the feedbacks between climate and vegetation. The\nmodel, as formulated, can provide insights into the effects of\nclimate change on ecosystem dynamics, but does not consider the\neffects of ecosystem changes on climate directly. However, the model\ncan provide, as outputs, factors that impact climate such as albedo,\nevapotranspiration, and trace gas fluxes (i.e., carbon dioxide,\nmethane, and nitrogen). These questions are also relevant to the\nBOREAS experiment.\n\nThe overall objective of our work was to capitalize on and develop the\nunique advantages of remote sensing data combined with models of\nforest ecosystem dynamics for characterizing northern/boreal forest\necosystems, especially with regard to the interpretation of landscape\npatterns and processes at local and regional scales.  Specific\nobjectives for the FED experiment at IP's Northern Experimental Forest\nincluded:\n\n1. Enhance the development of an integrated quantitative model which\n   simulates forest, soil, and energy dynamics processes in northern\n   forest environments. This will be achieved through modification and\n   continuing development of the three types of sub-models discussed\n   above.\n\n2. Develop improved remote sensing technology to infer biophysical\n   parameter inputs for forest succession and soil models. The\n   relationships among remote sensing and forest canopy\n   characteristics required by forest succession and soil process\n   models will be developed and tested.\n\n3. Develop a better understanding of the transfer and utilization of\n   energy in forest canopies. This goal is being accomplished via\n   collection of detailed spectral reflectance data in the field and\n   laboratory, and by exercising existing radiative transfer models.\n\n4. Use field and remote sensing observations to help infer where\n   landscape pattern and process ecosystem models succeed or fail at\n   local to regional spatial scales and interannual temporal\n   scales. This objective is being accomplished through comparison of\n   model predictions with field experimental data, and changes in\n   successional stage, bioproductivity, and other biophysical\n   parameters based on remotely sensed measurements.\n\n5.

Thus, we propose a multi-disciplinary\nprogram ot evaluate the seafloor accumulation, fate and benthic\ncommunity impacts of bloom material along a transect of three stations\ncrossing the Antarctic shelf in the Palmer LTER study area. Using a\nseasonal series of five cruises to our transects, we will test the\nfollowing hypotheses:\n\n1) A substantial proportion of spring/summer export production (circa\n50%) is deposited on the WAP shelf as phytodetritus or fecal pellets.\n\n2) The deposited bloom production is a source of labile POC (or a\n'food bank') for benthos for an extended period of time (months)\n\n3) Large amounts of labile bloom POC are rapidly subducted into the\nsediment column by the deposit-feeding and caching activities of\nbenthos\n\n4) Macrobenthic detritivores sustain a rapid increase in biomass and\nabundance following the spring/summer POC pulse\n\nTo test these hypotheses we will use multiple-core and box-core\nsamples, radiochemical profiles, sediment respirometry, and time-lapse\nbottom photography to evaluate (a) seabed deposition and lability of\nPOC, (b) patterns of POC mixing into sediments, (c) seasonal\nvariations in macrofaunal and megafaunal abundance, biomass and\nreproductive condition, and (d) rates of POC and silica mineralization\nand accumulation in the seabed. Fluxes of biogenic materials and\nradionuclides into midwater particle traps (D.Karl, P.I.) will be\ncontasted with our seabed deposition and burial rates to establish\nwater-column and seabed preservation efficiencies for these\nmaterials. Cruises (each 10-d in length) will be conducted to collect\nthese data in: November 1999 (shortly pre-bloom); Feb-Mar 2000 (at the\nend of the POC pulse); Apr-May 2000 (near the end of the ice-free\nsummer period), Sept-Oct 2000 (near the end of the winter-ice period),\nand Feb-Mar 2001 (end of second annual POC pulse). This project will\nsubstantially improve our understanding of the spring/summer\nproduction pulse on the WAP shelf, and its impacts on seafloor\ncommunities and carbon cycling in Antarctic coastal ecosystems.'\n\nCraig R Smith and David J DeMaster, Principal Investigators",

For more information about the experimental objectives\nand strategy, as well as references and contacts click on the\nappropriate link below.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. The DYCOMS-II field program is designed to collect data to\ntest large-eddy simulations of stratocumulus\n\n2. To test a recently proposed technique to measure large-scale\ndivergence\n\n3. To test our ability to close scalar budgets under ideal\nsituations\n\n4. To increase our understanding and of the statistical signature\nof the diurnal cycle in marine stratocumulus\n\nStrategies:\n\nOur basic strategy is to make use of a unique combination of\ninstrumentation and flight plans to measure both the large-scale\nenvironment and the turbulent dynamics of summertime, nocturnal,\nsubtropical marine stratocumulus.\n\nInstruments:\n\n1. EC-130Q Hercules: This four-engine, medium-size utility\nturboprop has been modified from a U.S. military tactical\naircraft to a versatile and capable research platform that will\ndeliver the scientific instrumentation to the target area. The\nHercules has a 10-hour flight endurance, covers a 2,900 nautical\nmile range at 20,000 ft, and carries a payload of up to 23,000\nlb. In addition to the standard sensors that measure atmospheric\nstate parameters, cloud physics, and radiation, the C-130 will be\nequipped with specialized instrumentation for measuring the state\nof the atmosphere away from the aircraft. These latter\ninstruments include the Staring (Scanning) Aerosol Backscatter\nLidar (SABL), the ATD Dropwindsonde System, and the Wyoming cloud\nradar.\n\n2. GPS Dropsondes: These third-generation dropsonde, use a new\nsensor module and a GPS receiver from Vaisala Inc. A unique\nsquare-cone parachute is used to reduce the initial shock load\nand slow and stabilize the sonde. The parachute is immediately\ndeployed on exit from the launch chute and streamers for about\nfive seconds until filled by ram-air. The stability of the square\ncone parachute is very good during the sonde's descent and\nreduces or eliminates any pendulum motion of the sonde. The fall\nspeeds of the sondes in the subtropical boundary layer are\nestimated to be between 10 and 15 m/s, yielding profiles with a\nresolution of less than 10m. Four sondes can be tracked from the\naircraft simultaneoulsy.\n\n3.  Scanning Aerosol Backscatter Lidar (SABL): The SABL lidar is\na compact and reliable instrument that detects backscatter from\nair molecules, aerosols, and hydrometeors (water and ice) and is\nused to measure and map distributions of relative aerosol\nconcentrations. The instrument operates at two wavelengths 532\n(green) and 1064 nm (infrared). On the C130 aircraft, it operates\nfrom zenith to nadir out to distances from 10 to 15 km with range\nresolutions down to 7.5 meters and along-track resolution to 4\nmeters. The lidar is not eye-safe and thus its scanning\ncapabilities are currently limited. During DYCOMS-II it will be\nmounted on a pod on a wing of the C130 and will be used primarily\nin a downward staring mode to provide information about cloud top\nstructure. Craig Walther and Bruce Morley of NCAR lead the SABL\ndevelopment.\n\n4. Wyoming Cloud Radar (WCR): The Wyoming Cloud Radar is an\nobservational system for the study of cloud structure and\ncomposition. It is intended for airborne use; principally on the\nWyoming KingAir. Operating at 95 GHz (3 mm wavelength), the radar\nprovides high-resolution measurements of reflectivity, velocity\nand polarization fields in vertical or horizontal\nsections. Coupled with the in situ observations of hydrometeors\nand air motions from the same aircraft these data yield unique\ninformation for analyses of cloud and precipitation\nprocesses. During DYCOMS it is proposed that the radar will be\nmounted on the C130. Gabor Vali of the University of Wyoming is\nthe primary contact for the implementation of the WCR during\nDYCOMS-II.\n\n5. Tunable Diode Laser (TDL): The tunable diode laser was\ndeveloped by Randall May of Spectra Sensors. The prototype\ninstrument is shown below mounted on the DC-8. The TDL on the\nC-130 is mounted under a wing pod. The TDL is an open-path\ninstrument that makes independent water vapor measurements every\n125 ms. Although as currently configured these measurements are\naveraged together to provide data at 1Hz, during DYCOMS each\nindependent sample will be saved. The resultant 8Hz data should\nbe sufficient for measuring fluxes outside of the surface\nlayer. Previous experience with the prototype instrument during\nCAMEX, and experience with the current instrument on 30 flights\nduring TOPSE suggests that it performs very well and should\nprovide unprecedented measurements of water-vapor in and around\nthe marine boundary layer, both in and out of clouds. Bruce\nGandrud of NCAR is a primary contact for the implementation of\nthe TDL.\n\n6. Fast Ozone: The NCAR NO chemiluminesence techique for\nmeasureing Ozone has been recently modified to increase its\nfrequency response. Preliminary tests with a cylindric reaction\nchamber indicate a frequency response of 5.5Hz with 1 ppbv of\nsensitivity. Tests with a conic reaction chamber have an slightly\nimproved frequency response (6.5Hz) and a slightly reduced (4\nppbv) sensitivity. The lead developer of this instrument is\nTeresa Campos of NCAR.\n\n7. Fast DMS (APIMS): The atmospheric pressure ionization mass\n  spectrometer (APIMS) has been developed by Alan Bandy and\n  colleagues at Drexel University. The method is based on mass\n  spectrometry using atmospheric pressure ionization as a source\n  of ions, and uses deuterated DMS as an internal standard. This\n  internal standard allows monitoring of the DMS mixing ratio\n  directly, which is a significant advantage in flux\n  determinations using eddy correlation. The instrument\n  sensitivity is about 100 counts per second per pptv. At a\n  typical DMS concentration of 100 pptv, the count rate is 104\n  counts per second. At a sample rate of 40 samples per second\n  this is 250 counts per sampling interval. This yields a\n  signal-to-noise of about 16 since the blank is negligible. The\n  instrument was first flown on test flights in November of 1999,\n  and we are hopeful that a second round of test flights\n  scheduled for August 2000 will demonstrate the capability of\n  the DMS instrument for entrainment mea!  surements.\n\n8. Particulate Volume Monitor (PVM-100A): The PVM is a cloud\n   microphysics probe designed to measure for small droplets the\n   liquid water content (LWC), droplet surface area (PSA), and\n   droplet effective radius (Re); see Fig. 1 (below). The PVM\n   makes these measurements optically on a cloud volume of about\n   10 cm^3, thus minimizing statistical sampling errors; and the\n   measurements are independent of air speed. The accuracy of the\n   PVM is estimated to be better than 10% for droplet spectra\n   with VMD (volume medium diameter) smaller than 30 um, and the\n   precision is on the order of 0.002 g/m^3. The PVM has the\n   unique capability of making these measurements at a rate\n   several orders of magnitude faster than other methods. An\n   example of 1000-Hz LWC measurements made with the PVM on the\n   C-130 during SCMS (Small Cumulus Microphysics Study) is shown\n   in Fig. 2 . This 10-cm resolution LWC data show a large amount\n   of fine scale in-cloud structure not seen in the 1-Hz data\n   often collected with!  other probes. The planned PVM data\n   collection rate for DYCOMS-II is 2000 Hz, which gives 5-cm\n   in-cloud resolution. This will be useful in studying the fine\n   scales potentially associated with the entrainment\n   process. Also accurate and fast LWC measurements can be\n   combined with vertical velocity measurements from a gust probe\n   to estimate the entrainment velocity into the Sc using a\n   q-conservation method described earlier by Steve Nicholls.\n\n Contact Information:\n\n Bjorn Stevens (Principal Investigator)\n Department of Atmospheric Sciences\n 405 Hilgard Avenue\n Box 951565\n Los Angeles CA 90095-1565\n (310) 206-7428 (voice) -5219 (fax)\n bstevens&#64atmos.ucla.edu\n 'http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~bstevens'\n\n DYCOMS-II Homepage: 'http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~bstevens/dycoms/'\n\n [Summary provided by UCLA Department of Atmospheric Science]",

In this forum, practioners work together on interoperability efforts across Earth and environmental science allowing self-governed and directed groups to emerge around common issues, ebbing and flowing as the need for them arises. These efforts catalyze connections across organizations, people, systems and data allowing for improved interoperability in distributed systems. By virtue of working in the larger community, ESIP members experience the network effect, which enables more coordinated cyberinfrastructure across domain-specific communities. Using this open, community-based, discipline and agency neutral approach, the ESIP Federation has a 14-year track record of success and continued growth.\n      \n      For more information, see: http://www.esipfed.org/",

Models are needed to design sampling programs and to synthesize data in order to understand what lived in the oceans in the past and what lives in the oceans today. These synthetic models can then be used to predict what will live in the oceans in the future. \n\nMoreover, modeling can help define the limits of knowledge: what is known, what is unknown but knowable, and what is likely to remain unknowable.",

The objective of the program was to collect daily air and\nprecipitation chemistry data for use in evaluating two Eulerian\nlong-range transport models: the Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM)\ndeveloped by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the\nAtmospheric Deposition and Oxidants Model (ADOM) developed jointly by\nEnvironment Canada, the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Energy,\nthe German Umweltbundesamt, and the Electric Power Research Institute.\nData collected have been and continue to be used to evaluate estimates\nof sulfate (SO4=) and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in air and\nprecipitation.  The field component of EMEFS had two parts:\n1) a surface network designed to collect data for operational model\nevaluations, i.e., over long-periods and large spatial scales, and 2)\nintensive surface and aircraft field campaigns to support short-term\ndiagnostic model evaluations.  The EMEFS surface network consisted of\napproximately 130 sites in five networks sponsored by different\ngovernmental and non-governmental agencies.  Site selection was\ncoordinated by the agencies to establish a regionally representative\nnetwork.  The five networks were:\nOEN: Operational Evaluation Network - funded by the Electric Power\nResearch Institute (25 EMEFS sites)\nCAPMoN: Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network - operated\nby Environment Canada, Atmospheric Environment Service (22 EMEFS\nsites)\nFADMP: Florida Acid Deposition Monitoring Program - funded by the\nFlorida Electric Power Coordinating Group (4 EMEFS sites)\nAPIOS: Acid Precipitation In Ontario Study - operated by the Ontario\nMinistry of Environment and Energy (18 EMEFS sites).\nAcid MODES: Acid Model Operational Diagnostic Evaluation Study -\nfunded by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (59 EMEFS sites\nincluding variability (VAR) and gradient (GRAD) special study\nsub-networks).  The Acid MODES variability sub-network was a four-site\ncluster of sites used to evaluate spatial concentration variability on\nthe 80 - 100 km grid scale of the models being evaluated.

ERICA is a follow-up study to the Genesis of Atlantic Lows\nExperiment (GALE), conducted in the winter of 1986.  Other contributors include\nseveral departments of the Navy and the Air Force as well as the National\nWeather Service (NWS), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),\nNational Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS),\nEnvironmental Research Laboratory (ERL), Department of Transportation (DOT),\nDepartment of Energy (DOE), National Science Foundation (NSF), National Center\nfor Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Air Weather Service (AWS), Atmospheric\nEnvironment Service (AES) of Toronto, Canada, along with universities and\nresearch organizations in the United States and Canada.  Operations are being\ncarried out at three main centers; the World Weather Building, Camp Springs,\nMaryland, Maritimes Weather Center, Bedford, Nova Scotia and Naval Air Station,\nBrunswick, Maine.  The field phase of ERICA began 1 December 1988 and ended 26\nFebruary 1989.  The experiment was designed to focus on east coast winter\nstorms that rapidly intensified over a few hours and a few hundred kilometers\nand deepened tens of millibars per six hours.

            "definition": "Background and rationale:\nAt some time or another most of the world's terrestrial ecosystems are\ndirectly affected by fire. Though some fires occur naturally\n(wildfires), by far the greater part are the result of human\nactivities. Much of the world's tropical savannahs are periodically\nburned; in Africa alone around 75% of the savannah burns annually, an\narea of more than 300 millions hectares. Forest fires, savannahs\nfires, burning of fuel wood, charcoal production and burning of\nagricultural wastes together consume an estimated 8680 million tons of\ndry plant material per year.\nThe consequences of biomass burning are extremely diverse. It affects\natmospheric chemistry, climate, vegetation distribution and, of course\nhuman avtivities. The ecological, environmental and economic effects\nof biomass burning occur across all scales, from the local to global,\nyet systematic documentation of global biomass burning patterns and\nhistory are not available. This lack of information is keenly felt,\nboth by the international scientific community, and by policy\nmakers. The research project FIre in global Resource and Environmental\nmonitoring (FIRE) has been initiated in 1994, by the Monitoring of\nTropical Vegetation unit (MTV) of the Commission of the European Union\nJoint Research Centre, in order to adress such issues during a 4 years\nperiod, with a key objective being the documenting of biomass burning\npatterns for the entire tropical belt and the analysis of such\npatterns in relation to land use/land cover dynamics.\nAn integrated approach to biomass burning studies:\nAt the 1991 Dahlem Workshop on Global Changes in the Perspective of\nthe Past, a proposal was made to integrate established fire behaviour\nand emission models into a new approach, where ecosystem\ncharacterisation, in terms of fuel situation and satellite\nidentification of fire occurrence are the starting point. The FIRE\nproject is concentrating in particular on those acpects of the Dahlem\nmodel driven by satellite data.\nSatellite observations as main source of information:\nEarth observation from space provides systematic and consistent\nmeasurements of a series of parameters related to fire and fire\nimpacts. Fire detection from space currently relies on visible and\nthermal information from sensors on the Meteosat, Landsat, SPOT and\nNOAA satellites.\nThese systems together cover a range of spatial, spectral and temporal\nresolutions which on the one hand permit detailed study of individual\nfires, and on the other allow regular monitoring of the incidence of\nfire for entire continents.\nThe Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on the NOAA\nsatellites is the main source of data for the studies done by the FIRE\nproject.  Historical archives of these data, on a daily basis at 4 km\nresolution (the Global Area Coverage data, GAC), extend back to 1981:\nthe FIRE project has done the processing and analysis of these\nAVHRR-GAC data for the african continent. The resulting data sets are\nused for continental scale vegetation studies, more specifically for\ndetection of land cover changes, and for documenting spatio- temporal\nvariations in burning patterns for the continent of Africa over the\nlast decade.\nMore complete documentation of burning patterns for the whole tropical\nbelt has been initiated by the FIRE project using the global 1-km\nresolution AVHRR image archive established at the U.S. satellite data\narchive, Sioux Falls, under the auspices of the IGBP. Analysis of\nthese data has required considerable development of processing\nenvironments: An automatic method for global detection of vegetation\nfires, which adjusts as necessary to accomodate seasonal and spatial\nfactors, has been developed and applied succesfully for the processing\nand analysis of one week of daily global data (14 Gb of data). The\nFIRE project is currently extending the processing to six months of\ndaily 1-km global data.\nIn the same time, detection and assessment of burnt areas are becoming\nkey issues in the overall research effort of the FIRE project. Data\nprovided by the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR-1) onboard the\nERS satellite, are being used to quantify the extent of burnt\nsurfaces. Last, a mobile AVHRR data receiving station is used by the\nFIRE project, in the framework of ground experimental campaigns, to\nvalidate fire detection methods for different tropical ecosystems, and\nto provide input to fire management programmes at country level.\nAssembling and use of consistent data sets on\nBB dynamics adapted to the modelling of\nsoil-vegetation-atmosphere exchanges and\ntheir evolution in time\nThe FIRE project is involved in co-operative research related to the\nrole of biomass burning in tropospheric and precipitations chemistry,\nforest monitoring, land cover changes. As such a great effort is done\nto assemble and format the fire related informations, as derived from\nremote sensing, in consistent data sets adapted to the modelling of\nsoil-vegetation- atmosphere exchanges and their evolution in time:\nsuch data sets are currently sustaining the FIRE project contributions\nto international experiments among which the IGBP-IGAC activity\nEXPRESSO (EXPeriment for Regional Sources and Sinks of Oxydants) and\nto a research activity of the European Union on the modelling of\nemissions of black carbon aerosols at global scale. Moreover the FIRE\nproject is involved in a co-operative research with the UE's TREES\n(TRopical Ecosystem and Environment observation from Space) project:\nthe detection of fires is an essential part of the alarm system under\ndevelopment, in the TREES project, to pinpoint zones of active\ndeforestation.\nReferences:\nGregoire J-M., 1993, Description quantitative des regimes de feu en\nzone soudanienne d'Afrique de l'Ouest.

            "definition": "Discovery (OV-103) was NASA's third space shuttle orbiter to join the fleet, arriving for the first time at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in November 1983.\n\nAfter checkout and processing, it was launched on Aug. 30, 1984, for its first mission, 41-D, to deploy three communications satellites.\n\nSince that inaugural flight, Discovery has completed more than 30 successful missions, surpassing the number of flights made by any other orbiter in NASA's fleet. Just like all of the orbiters, it has undergone some major modifications over the years. The most recent began in 2002 and was the first carried out at Kennedy. It provided 99 upgrades and 88 special tests, including new changes to make it safer for flight.\n\nImage left: Space Shuttle Discovery lifts off Pad B at the Kennedy Space Center on September 12, 1993, to begin STS-51. Image credit: NASA\n\nDiscovery has the distinction of being chosen as the Return to Flight orbiter twice. The first was for STS-26 in 1988, and the second when it carried the STS-114 crew on NASA's Return to Flight mission to the International Space Station in July 2005.\n\nThe choice of the name 'Discovery' carried on a tradition drawn from some historic, Earth-bound exploring ships of the past. One of these sailing forerunners was the vessel used in the early 1600s by Henry Hudson to explore Hudson Bay and search for a northwest passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\n\nAnother such ship was used by British explorer James Cook in the 1770s during his voyages in the South Pacific, leading to the discovery of the Hawaiian Islands. In addition, two British Royal Geographical Society ships have carried the name 'Discovery' as they sailed on expeditions to the North Pole and the Antarctic.\n\nDestined for exploring the heavens instead of the seas, it was only fitting that NASA's Discovery carried the Hubble Space Telescope into space during mission STS-31 in April 1990, and provided both the second and third Hubble servicing missions (STS-82 in February 1997 and STS-103 in December 1999).\n\nSummary provided by http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/shuttleoperations/orbiters/discovery-info.html",

Deterioration occurs for various reasons that include handling, transport, exposure to light, moisture and atmospheric pollution.\n\nRealizing the need to conserve the information on existing maps, which underpin the fast-developing thematic mapping strategies to support soil protection, the Institute of Environment and Sustainability (IES) in the European Commission (Italy) and ISRIC – World Soil Information initiated the European Digital Archive of Soil Maps (EuDASM). The immediate objective is to transfer soil information into digital format, with the maximum resolution possible, to preserve the information of paper maps that are vulnerable to deterioration.\n\nBeyond data rescue, the archive is expected to develop into a common platform for storing soil maps from around the world and making the information readily accessible. Organisations that maintain soil map archives in paper form, and wishing to conserve this information by transferring it into digital form, are invited to join the EuDASM programme.\n\nThe initiative for this programme was taken by Dr Luca Montanarella of the European Joint Research Centre and Dr Otto Spaargaren of ISRIC – World Soil Information in October 2004. The first level success for this initiative was figured out by completion of the around 2000 soil maps pertaining to the African continent. Through this digitization programme the map quality and precision of information were preserved against further loss assuming to be required for future use by land resources specialists.\n\nSummary Provided By: http://eusoils.jrc.it/esdb_archive/EuDASM/indexes/about.htm",

In a\nseries of phases funded by the Northeast Consortium (2000-2005),  we have\ndeveloped low-cost strategies to measure bottom temperature and salinity and,\nmost recently, surface current velocity with the help of nearly 100 lobstermen \ndispersed along the entire New England coast.  We hope to extend our existing\nmulti-year time series (as well as our monitoring capabilities), continue\nintegration with the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System (GoMOOS), and\ncontribute to whatever operational system is developed for our region in the\nfuture.\n\nThe eMOLT partners currently include all the major lobstermen associations in\nNew England (Maine, Massachusetts, Downeast, and Atlantic Offshore), a NOAA\nscientist, the Gulf of Maine Lobster Foundation, and the Marine Science\nDepartment at the Southern Maine Community College.  Having created this\nnetwork of participating fishermen, our primary goal is to supply these\nindividuals with the latest in low-cost instrumentation sufficient for\nmaintaining continuous time series of physical variables at fixed locations and\ndepths.  Our database now consist of 1.3 million hourly records of temperature,\n80k hourly records of salinity, and 40k satellite drifter fixes.  While our\nmission is primarily motivated by lobster science and the need to document\nbackground conditions, we make our database accessible to the general public\nand the recently-formed GoM Ocean Data Partnership in the form of web served\nproducts and raw data (see www.emolt.org).\n\nIn our quest to minimize instrumentation cost, we have partnered with engineers\nin the private sector to  develop devices that may be of interest to the\noceanographic community in general.  The first is a GPS drifter at nearly a\nthird the cost of conventional units that implements the SENS technology with\nthe GLOBALSTAR low-orbiting satellite system.  These units have already logged\nmore than 30 thousand kilometers of  ocean. Another is a real-time bottom\ntemperature sensor (attached to lobster traps) that wirelessly transmits data\nto a shipboard system as it is hauled on deck.  Both of these units should be\ncommercially available in 2005.\n\nWe expect the primary users of eMOLT data, aside from the lobstermen\nthemselves, will be local ocean circulation modelers.  The need for data in\ninitialization, assimilation, and validation of their numerical simulations is\nbecoming more and more obvious.  The complex  time-varying nature of the Gulf\nof Maine system calls for incorporating  as much data as possible in order to\ngenerate realistic flow fields.  We hope to supplement the data supplied by \nGoMOOS by providing modelers with a extensive array of  bottom observations as\nwell as Lagrangian drifter tracks.  Our hope is that these numerical models\nwill someday help in our understanding of lobster larvae drift and the fate of\nany particles for that matter, such as Harmful Algal Blooms, along our coast. \nWhat are the mechanisms that govern the both the short-term and long-term\nvariability of the GoM ecosystem and can we generate realistic, time-varying,\n3-d simulations of these changes?\n\nOur philosophy is that local fishermen already spend their days at sea,  have\nthe biggest stake in preserving our coastal marine resources, and are the most\nknowledgeable of the local waters.  Their interest, curiosity, and enthusiasm\nare sincere.  They should play an important part in our nation's Integrated\nOcean Observing Systems. \n\n[Abstract taken from http://www.emolt.org/]",

That activity has a history and a purpose of its own, valid and valuable independently of the proposed IPY activity, but will prove additionally valuable as a basis for the proposed activity. \n\nSecond, the ECONOR project, funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Nordic Council of Ministers, has seven participating institutions throughout the Arctic (see list, concluding section). The project has built a network and started documentation and analysis of the importance of the Arctic to the rest of the world. Using the network through workshops and collection of data and analysis, the project focuses on trade and other economic flows between the Arctic regions and the rest of the world. Briefly, the draft report concludes: i) the Arctic is important to the rest of the world as a resource provider through trade flows, not only because of its unique natural habitats and the livelihoods of the people living there; ii) climate change may raise the value of certain resources to the rest of the world (increased growth, reduced costs), while reducing the value of others; iii) increased access, due to receding sea ice, will not only increase the value of important resources, but also put stress on existing control regimes, including geopolitically through maritime transport and military presence. \n\nProposed activities in the ECONOR II project are as follows:\n\na) The value of Arctic natural resources. The value of natural resources (oil, gas and other mineral resources, fish, forests, tourism) will here be estimated based on an optimal control regime, i.e. assuming that challenges such as over fishing, stalemate and conflict will somehow be handled adequately. Environmental stresses will be among the important management challenges in this critically vulnerable area. \nb) Sovereign control and access to resources in the Arctic. This activity builds on existing boundaries of sovereign control, and asks what important coordination requirements there are between countries in order for resources and activities to be managed sensibly in an era when both access to and pressure on arctic resources will be increasing. The activity comprises analysis of political economy, but limited to the perspective of interests between countries. \nc) The political economy of natural resources development in the Arctic. This project applies concepts from the literature on decentralization, to analyze how institutions within each country influences both how resources are developed and how the rent is distributed. Is it the case, for instance, that delegation of decision-making power to an Arctic region, or to indigenous people (or both) will influence how the resources are developed, employment consequences in the Arctic, and how beneficial resource developments will be? \n\nFor all the three activities, there is a required minimum level of participation from the network institutions, and this comprises data provision and descriptive analysis. As an example of how this goes beyond data on resources and activity levels, information is required on how decision making is delegated to Arctic sub-national entities in the federal countries (USA, Canada, Russia) and in the unitary countries (Norway, Greenland, Iceland, Faeroe Islands, Sweden, Finland). On this basis, specialized activities will be built, as funding allows.",

            "definition": "The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (2004, 2005) concluded that predicted changes in climate and UV in the Arctic are expected to have far-reaching impacts on the hydrology and ecology of freshwater ecosystems. Key effects include changes in the distribution, abundance and ecology of aquatic species in various trophic levels, dramatic alterations in the physical environment that makes up their habitat, changes to the chemical properties of that environment, and alterations to the processes that act on and within freshwater ecosystems. Interactions of climatic variables, such as temperature and precipitation, with freshwater ecosystems are highly complex and hence can be propagated through ecosystems in ways that are often difficult to predict. This is partly because of our still relatively poor understanding of the structure and function of arctic freshwater systems and their basic inter-relationships with climate and other environmental variables, as well as by a paucity of long-term freshwater monitoring sites and integrated hydro-ecological research programs in the Arctic. Predictions of hydro-ecological impacts are further complicated by synergistic and cumulative effects.\nThe Arctic Council accepted the findings from the ACIA and directed two of its scientific working groups (Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) and Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP)) to review the ACIA findings and develop follow-on programmes and activities to address the key knowledge gaps that were identified. One of the outcomes of this process by the CAFF working group was the implementation of the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring\nProgramme (CBMP) formally released in September, 2005 (http://www.caff.is). The CBMP calls for the development of a number of specific monitoring networks designed to quantify the status and trends of Arctic biota of primary importance to the ecological integrity of Arctic ecosystems and the culture and livelihood of indigenous peoples.\nBuilding on existing regional and national aquatic biomonitoring and research programs in the Arctic, this proposal is concerned with the development and implemenation of a freshwater biodiversity monitoring and research network that focuses on obtaining a circumpolar perspective on the current and future status of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem structure and function. The network will focus on data collection, interpretation and dissemination on the status and trends of pelagic and benthic macroinvertebrates, phyoplankton and microbial communities/assemblages, and macrophytes) in representative lentic (lake, pond, wetlands) and lotic (river, stream) ecosystems.\nComplementing the proposed Char Monitoring Network (Reist) and the overall CBMP framework (Raillard) , specific goals during the IPY period (2006-2008) will be to: 1) establish and formalize the circumpolar network through workshops, linkages and outreach to indigenous peoples, researchers, conservation groups, etc.; 2) prepare a state of aquatic ecosystem biodiversity report through collating and analyses of existing information; and, 3) establish relevant parameters for continued monitoring and assessment of aquatic biodiversity; 3) create a database of georeferenced and genetically barcoded specimens; and, 4) establish the network of long-term monitoring/research sites/teams in as many Arctic countries as possible. The IPY-related outcomes will be used as a foundation to secure long-term funding for the Network, establish legacy databases, and launch new approaches (e.g., genetic barcoding) and research topics suitable for long-term monitoring and research, as recommeded by ACIA. The scientific products of the network will be used to support decision-makers responsible for the management, conservation and protection of aquatic ecosystems and related biological resources in the Arctic.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=202",

During the field experiment FRAMZY in April 1999 a Fram Strait cyclone and its impact on the ice drift was measured using a research aircraft and an array of 15 ice buoys. The synoptic-scale cyclone moved from the south into the area. It was discernible up to 500 hPa in the pressure field, but the horizontal temperature contrast of up to 16 K between the warm and cold sides was confined to the lowest 500 m. The average ice drift was 0.21 ms−1 toward 200° but increased to 0.6 ms−1 during the cyclone passage. The ice drift amounted to 1.6% of the geostrophic wind with a turning angle of 51° on the average. Comparisons between the aircraft measurements and operational weather model analyses show an insufficient representation of the temperature inversion and indicate an underestimate of wind speed and, thus, momentum transfer to the sea ice.\n\nSummary Provided By:\n\nhttp://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2003/2002JD002638.shtml",

Led by the Universities Space Research Association (USRA), ESSE 21 offers colleges and universities small, competitive grants to develop Earth system science courses, curricula, and degree programs. ESSE 21 engages a collaborative community of educators and scientists as partners in jointly developing and sharing courses and learning resources focused on Earth system science research and application. ESSE 21 places special emphasis on reaching minority serving institutions. Sixty-three teams have been funded since 1991 supporting faculty from different disciplines to come together to develop and offer courses with relevant and compelling science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) content focused on understanding Earth. ESSE 21 participants stimulate their students' critical and creative thinking with Earth system models, research results, data and visualizations available from NASA and the broader interdisciplinary community engaged in Earth system science. These resources increase opportunities for teaching and learning about the Earth as a system while developing competency in underlying STEM principles.\n\nUnderstanding the Earth as a system is central to the IPY theme. ESSE 21 and IPY share common goals, seeking to attract and develop the next generation of scientists, engineers, leaders and citizens mindful of Earth system connections. The IPY seeks to make the polar regions and processes better known to people beyond the polar regions and offers an opportunity for people living in the Arctic to strengthen their communication with the rest of the world. An ESSE 21 partnership with the IPY will forward the goals of both organizations. ESSE 21 seeks to increase awareness of IPY science themes and learning resources in the broader undergraduate ESS community being served by the program, focus interest in the role of polar regions in ESS among the ESSE 21 participants and others, and foster collaboration between the ESS educators and the broader IPY science and education partners.\n\nESSE 21 will include a section on the International Polar Year (IPY) as a topical supplement to its Design Guide for Undergraduate Earth System Science Education. ESSE 21 intends to develop partnerships with other organizations that have submitted Expressions of Interest, such as EoI 404, which represents a cluster of 17 organizations commited to IPY education. Other EoIs that will be contacted to explore ways that ESSE 21 can contribute include 196, 315, 341, 468.",

These\ninitial EPA projects, for example,will:\n\n  Develop improved air quality tracking systems for the Cleveland, OH area.\n  Provide immediate clean-water information at Los Angeles, CA beaches.\n  Provide daily information to help children avoid harmful exposure to\n   ultraviolet radiation in Phoenix, AZ.\n  Keep track of water quality in Long Island Sound, NY.\n  Reduce the risk of lead exposure to children in their own backyards in\n   the Boston, MA area.\n  Provide information on contamination at hazardous-waste sites in\n   Northern New Jersey.\n  Keep better track of toxic air pollutants in the San Francisco, CA area.\n\nEPA will coordinate EMPACT activities among Federal, States, tribal,\nand local governments. Additionally, groups such as community health\nofficials, businesses, industries, schools, and environmental\norganizations will be involved.\n\nTo help make EMPACT work, EPA will work closely with two other Federal\nagencies: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\nand the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The resources and expertise of\nthese two agencies will help EPA achieve nationwide consistency in\nmeasuring environmental data, managing that data, and effectively\ndelivering it to the public.

The West Greenland society relies almost entirely on marine resources for industrial as well as subsistence utilisation. Today, the West Greenland marine ecosystem is very productive and sustains fisheries which contribute 95% of Greenland's total export value. The Greenland Marine ecosystem also sustains seals and whales who feed in the area during summer, and, from the entire North Atlantic, seabirds by the million find a critical winter habitat resource in the ice-free area. Human use of the West Greenland marine ecosystem presents a complex mosaic of small- and large-scale commercial fishing, as well as subsistence and recreational fishing and hunting. \n\nThe Arctic marine environment is vulnerable to impacts of human activities and is of high climatic sensitivity. In the Arctic, greenhouse warming over the next century is predicted to be 2-4 times higher than at lower latitudes. Increased human impact on marine ecosystems combined with effects of global climate change heightens the need for sustainable ecosystem-based management. Today, knowledge of the interaction between climate change, natural resources, human behaviour, and governance structure is fragmentary. Consequently, the knowledge base for ecosystem management is inadequate. There is a need for co-ordination of research efforts to overcome the fragmentation of these diverse fields of enquiry. An integrated research approach is needed to develop models for sustainable ecosystem management.\n\nThe West Greenland marine ecosystem is an ideal model area for integrated studies of ecosystems, resources, and associated social factors, where general theory for ecosystem dynamics and ecosystem management can be developed and tested. Management systems must take into account the wishes and influences of diverse domestic users, science-based advice from national and international bodies, and the influence of national and international public opinion. Finally, ECOGREEN can serve as a model for integrated studies of ecosystems, resources, and associated social factors for indigenous people in other Arctic regions and form the basis for establishing a real decision support system.\n\nSpecific tasks will include:\n\nDescribing and improving the understanding of physical and bio-geo-chemical interactions through field observations and empirical, dynamic and predictive modelling with emphasis on 1) Climate change (atmosphere, ice, physical and bio¬logical oceano¬graphy) 2) Pelagic-benthic coupling 3) Lateral coupling (fjord, shelf and Deep Ocean) \n\nQuantifying and improving the understanding of the eco¬system structure and productivity with emphasis on 1) Biodiversity 2) Interactions and coupling between tropic levels, and 3) Spatial and temporal scales \n\nIdentifying and describing the main social, economic and institutional drivers behind environmentally significant human behaviours with emphasis on 1) Fishing and hunting 2) Governance institutions and social interactions\n\nIdentifying and quantifying interactions between human activities and the ecosystem with emphasis on 1) Ecosystem impacts of hunting and fishing, including by-catch, discards, fish processing offal, habitat impacts of fishing gear, habitat disturbance or loss due to other human activities 2) Ecosystem impacts of other anthropogenic disturbances\n\nAnalysing the transfer of the West Greenland experiences to a generic approach for a sustainable ecosystem-based management with emphasis on 1) Reflections and operationalisation of the concept of ecosystem-based management and 2) Transfer of the West Greenland experiences to a generic approach for ecosystem management applicable into a broader Arctic context",

To meet this objective DAMOCLES will, following the approach of Numerical Weather Prediction Centers, develop an integrated system for obtaining relevant geophysical observations, transferring them to a central databank, distributing them to the modelling centers, and producing nowcasts and forecasts of the Arctic climate. But since there exists no such thing as an Arctic Ocean Observing System, nor fully validated models for Arctic climate, nor accepted methods for forecasting of climate, a number of specific objectives need to be met in DAMOCLES: \n\n1. Synoptic observational coverage of the Arctic Ocean sea-ice cover \nThe variability of sea-ice thickness, extent, concentration, ice-type and drift will be monitored by remote and in-situ systems in near real-time. Sea-ice dynamics and thermodynamics will be scrutinized to better understand their role for the large-scale ice-atmosphere-ocean system \n2. Synoptic observation and investigation of atmospheric key processes \nAimed at a better predictability of the Arctic weather and climate key processes are investigated in a combined observational/process-modelling effort: the effects of Arctic cyclone on sea-ice in terms of heat and moisture transport, an improvement of boundary-layer physics over ice and ocean, an improvement of the radiative transfers and its interaction with snow and sea-ice \n3. Synoptic observation of the Arctic Ocean circulation and key processes \nAn observational system will be set up with the aim to improve the understanding of the large-scale circulation of the Arctic Ocean and its vertical and lateral exchanges as well as the communication between central basins and the shelves. New techniques will be used to assess synoptically the state of the ocean under the ice and the fluxes of heat, salt and volume across the boundaries.\n4. Integration and assimilation of observations with large-scale models \nModel sensitivities will be investigated and performance be improved by model-model and model-data comparison, aiming at an improved predictability.\nObservations will be enhanced by a set of assimilation activities to deliver re-analysed Arctic variables in time and space\n\nTo address the question of potential impacts of climate change in the Arctic the following specific objective of DAMOCLES can be formulated:\n\n5. Assessment of impact on environment and humans \nThe observationally supported model improvements, the model sensitivities and past ranges of variability will be combined with new field data. The aim is to evaluate improved predictability and its consequences, as well as the impact of projected changes on adaptation capabilities and vulnerability of the environment and human activities.\n\nExploitation and dissemination of the results are key elements of the project. Thus, a 6th specific objective is:\n6.User-friendly return of information to the community\nA website will be available; giving the community updated information about the state of the Arctic (e.g. real-time information of key atmospheric, ice and ocean variables) as well as information about the progress of the science of DAMOCLES. Education will be provided, through workshops and student scholarships. Results will be published, both in scientific journals and in the popular-scientific press. The PIs will generally make themselves available to the public to the best of their ability.",

The DIS will work closely with the Data Policy and Management Sub-Committee (Data Committee) and other data management bodies and observing networks to develop the IPY data and information policy and strategy. The DIS will then be the primary implementer of that strategy and policy recognizing that the strategy will need to evolve with the science needs and developments of IPY.\nAlthough much will depend on the strategy that is developed, we envision the DIS as an overall data management consultant and coordinator and a central data portal for an internationally distributed data management system. The DIS will continue to establish close partnerships with data centers and organizations around the world to build on existing systems. We will also work with each specific IPY cluster to ensure appropriate centralized data description and distributed archiving. Regional or discipline-specific affinity centers coordinated by the DIS will facilitate appropriate data description and archive. For example the Frozen Ground Data Center at the WDC, Boulder is working closely with the permafrost cluster, while the proposed Arctic Peoples Observations Center (EoI 358) could coordinate community-based monitoring data. Other potential affinity centers based on our current partners could include Russian data, Chinese data, data for education and outreach, remote sensing data, geospatial data infrastructures (regional and global), paleoenvironmental data, marine biological data, bibliographic data, and others (a detailed spreadsheet is available on request). Many of these affinity centers will likely create their own means of access to the data. It is unrealistic for a central DIS to be the single or even primary means of access, but we would like to establish a means to automatically share metadata across the system through a common (perhaps XML-based) framework\nSpecific activities of the DIS could include:\nCollection (automated, where possible) of catalog metadata for all IPY projects and provision of Web-based portals to all IPY data archived around the world.\nExamination and implementation of data discovery tools and data presentation schemes such as an interoperable web-based map server to enhance data access through a Web portal (could include a locator map for all IPY projects). \nIdentification of existing tools to facilitate data management, and build on those to meet the needs of the IPY community. For example, the Global Change Master Directorys (GCMD) metadata authoring tool, docBuilder, could be customized.\nServing as a focal point for cross-disciplinary data integration, especially across the natural and social sciences.\nCreation of appropriate management tools for non-numerical data such as interview transcripts, photographs, and videotapes.\nCollaboration with eGY to make data management best practices and principles available to researchers and agencies, via Web pages, workshops, and other channels.\nActing as a clearinghouse and facilitator for data management and integration issues that need research, discussion, and resolution.\nWorking with eGY to increase awareness of the value of data management for both numerical and non-numerical data.\nResponsive service to the IPY research community regarding data management\nThe DIS will take advantage of existing data management infrastructures, organizations, and technologies such as National and World Data Centers, the Joint Committee for Antarctic Data Management (JCADM), the GCMD, virtual observatories, and the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure. This distributed system will allow for appropriate management of the various types of data including social science and physical science data, and analog collections. The distributed nature of the system will also encourage development of new and experimental data access methods, including data mining technology and innovative data presentation methods that facilitate data integration. \nIt is essential, however, to ensure ready and equitable access to and effective long-term preservation of the data. The DIS will assist distributed archives in adhering to sound data management principles and best practices as defined by the Data Committee, eGY, CODATA, WCRP CliC, JCADM, our partners, and other entities. We will ensure that these principles build upon existing international standards such the Open Archival Information System Reference Model and the ISO19115 metadata standard. The DIS will take advantage of emerging shared resources in the geosciences community, such as the effort to develop an international geophysical sample number (IGSN). In addition, the DIS could assist data providers in addressing human subjects protections and confidentiality issues for social science data and for other types of geo-referenced data.\n\nInformation provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=49",

The European network ARENA has started in January, 2006, and is devoted to this task. Among the observational niches, some are already clearly identified: submillimeter wavelengths, high angular resolution, as well as Wide field IR and optical observations, and continuous observations over days or weeks. The IPY offers a unique opportunity to discuss with national and international agencies the frame for a large astronomical infrastructure in Antarctica and to undertake its development.\n\nThe development of astronomy at Dome C, for which several French and international teams (Italy, Australia, China, Germany, United Kingdom…) have expressed their interest, has to be carried out in several steps.

Climate changes are expected to produce faster and greater changes in high-latitude regions, because they are likely to be amplified by alterations in albedo, atmospheric precipitation and permafrost. These changes will affect Antarctic life forms, from the individual and population scale to whole communities. A better knowledge of interactions among climate, geomorphological, geopedological and hydrological features, biological and genetic diversity, and functioning of Antarctic ecosystems across broad scale gradients, is necessary to point out weak points of these interactions and to achieve a better understanding of climate-induced changes in ecosystems at lower latitudes, where responses of biotic communities to external forcing are buffered by more complex interactions and feedback processes. Through the involvement of a selected number of Italian and Czech research groups on Antarctic biology and ecology, and an ad-hoc improvement of scientific and logistic integration and exchanges between Italy and other (SCAR) countries, our intent is to study the effects of climatic and environmental changes, as well as the impact of anthropogenic contaminants on organisms and ecosystems of northern Victoria Land, James Ross Island (Antarctic Peninsula), and Patagonia. As Antarctica receives pollutants from local sources (e.g., research stations, tourism) and acts as a cold trap for atmospheric mercury and persistent organic pollutants from other continents and secondary local arising organic photo-pollutants, our aim is to establish possible sources, deposition patterns, and biological effects of persistent pollutants, through the collection and analysis of widely distributed species of uni- and pluricellular organisms. Key species of organisms will also be collected across the latitudinal transect to study their origin, evolutionary responses to different climatic and environmental conditions, genetic links and interactions with relatives in the rest of the world. Through a functional genomic approach, the evolution of structural modifications of genes responsible for adaptations to cold, dry and salty environments, will be investigated to identify biochemical markers, which can provide means to study reactions to climate and environmental changes. In selected dominating moss and lichen species, the rate of photosynthesis and respiration will be measured and the acclimation/adaptation to long-term and short-term action of stress factors such as radiation, dehydration and low temperature will be studied. We propose internationally coordinated expeditions in northern Victoria Land, James Ross Island and Patagonia, with exchange of researchers and logistic support among Italian, Czech, and other national polar operators (austral summer 2007/08) to study: (1) soil formation processes and soil organic matter, (2) long-range transport and deposition of persistent contaminants, (3) Antarctic ecosystem biodiversity and functioning (4) the phylogeny and genetic variability of bacterial, protozoan, cryptogamic, and invertebrate populations.",

ELOKA will be a central data portal, data management service, networking service, and resource center related to the knowledge and observations of Arctic residents. In setting up these pioneer goals, ELOKA will make a major contribution to one of the IPY 2007-2008 missions, namely, to bridge scientific studies of polar environments with the observations and ecological knowledge of polar residents. ELOKA will be an important tool in facilitating contributions from, and access by, Arctic communities to IPY research and future Arctic research.\n\nOne of the challenges of local and traditional knowledge (LTK) research and community-based monitoring to date has been effective and appropriate means of recording, storing, and managing data and information. It has been a challenge to find effective means of making community-based data and information available to Arctic residents and researchers, as well as other interested groups such as teachers, students and decision makers. ELOKA seeks to fill this gap. ELOKA will have a strong emphasis on serving Arctic community-based organizations and research through support for local and traditional knowledge projects and community-based monitoring projects by developing new management systems for data in non-numerical formats such as video, audio, maps, artwork, and photographs, and context-specific data such as interview transcripts and recorded oral histories. In ELOKA, data management does not mean data control. ELOKA will be a collaboratively designed tool that various organizations, communities, and projects can use under their own terms to help them store, search and share information. ELOKA will help LTK and community-based projects store and manage their data if that is their need, or simply provide links to those projects that are managing their own information. At the same time, ELOKA will help to negotiate and establish protocols so information is comparable across projects and regions (e.g. work to develop common approaches to metadata). ELOKA will take up the challenge to design systems of data stewardship that will respect the unique sensitivities and protections needed in community-based projects, while still allowing for broad searches for information. \n\nThe World Data Center for Glaciology (WDC) and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in the U.S. propose to coordinate ELOKA. Drawing from and building upon existing data management resources and experienced staff that already handle diverse sources and forms of information, WDC/NSIDC will provide the technical backbone needed for ELOKA. With the technical component available to build on, ELOKA then proposes to collaborate with projects and organizations such as the Arctic Residents Network (ARN), Arctic Community-Based Environmental Monitoring Observation and Information Stations, and CAFF's (Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna) CBMP (Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program), to work on issues of best practices and cross-community collaboration. ELOKA will work closely with the proposed IPY Data and Information Service (DIS) and with indigenous organizations at all levels, such as RAIPON (Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North) and ICC-Greenland (Inuit Circumpolar Conference-Greenland). ELOKA would be part of broader consortiums for Arctic observation and monitoring by providing an LTK focus for such as programs as COMAAR (Consortium for Coordination of Observation and Monitoring of the Arctic for Assessment and Research), the above-mentioned CBMP, and CEON (Circumarctic Environmental Observatories Network). We have partnered with a number of LTK and community-based projects (see 4.2) to initiate the development of ELOKA and will continue to build partnerships with community-based programs, organizations and networks during IPY and beyond. Feedback from the individual projects and organizations contributing and using information at ELOKA will be a key part to the development process. Many community-based projects not submitting proposals to IPY are also interested in ELOKA some of these are listed in 4.2. We expect our partner list to grow in coming months.",

Reindeer herders traditional knowledge needs to be documented now before much of their understanding is lost due to societal/cultural transformations associated with globalization. Reindeer herding is the geographically most extensive form of animal husbandry in the Eurasian Arctic and sub-Arctic. Some 3 million reindeer provide the basis of the livelihood of herders and hunters in over 20 ethnic groups, managing pasture areas of 4 mill km2 which recently have become extremely important for other industrial interests (chiefly oil and gas development). \nReindeer have major cultural and economic significance for indigenous peoples of the north. The human-ecological systems in the North, like reindeer pastoralism, are sensitive to change, perhaps more than in virtually any other region of the globe, due in part to the variability of the Arctic climate and the characteristic ways of life of indigenous Arctic peoples. High sensitivity not withstanding, little is known about the vulnerability of such systems to change. Understanding and measuring vulnerability requires assessment of systems ability to adapt to impact and the extent to which freedom to adapt is constrained. EALÀT will therefore also examine the current state and changes of the polar environment (IPY theme 1 and 2). The network will examine traditional knowledge to adaptation in, and the vulnerability of reindeer pastoralism in case studies in Sapmi, Nenetsia, Yamal, Sakha, and Chukotka to change. It will explore (i) the influence of climate variability and change on reindeer, reindeer pastoralism and herding societies and (ii) the extent to which institutions and governance constrain, or create opportunities in, herders ability to cope with and to adapt to the effects of climate change. In addition, because many key institutions, markets, and governance affecting reindeer herders are based outside the Arctic, there are societal polar-global linkages superimposed upon the climate system and biogeochemical linkages (IPY theme 3). The limits of the adaptive capacity of reindeer husbandry must be defined, documented and explored together with the potential role of herders traditional understanding of, and techniques for, reducing their vulnerability for the effects of climate change. \n\nThe IPY EALÀT-network study follows up the Arctic Council ACIA report (Arctic Council 2004: Arctic Climatic Impact Assessment). The philosophy underlying EALÀT is wholly consistent with the recommendations of the ministerial meeting of the Arctic Council at Iceland on 24. November 2004. The Council agreed that warming of the Arctic is occurring faster than previously thought and that indigenous peoples will experience substantial challenges to their economies and cultures as a result. It is therefore important to focus, as does EALÀT, on the ability of reindeer herders to respond to these changes. \n\nWe believe that valuing traditional and scientific knowledge equally and, hence, integrating herders experience and competence within the scientific method will enable us to contribute towards reducing the vulnerability of reindeer husbandry to the effects of climate change. Local effects of warming of the global climate during the next 30 to 50 years are likely to be pronounced over reindeer pastures in the north. EALÀT will adopt a novel methodological approach, focusing on documentation, research, monitoring, outreach and communication. \n\nWe recognise that the ability to adapt to change is based on knowledge embodied in herders language, the institutions of herding and the actions of individual herders. International Centre for Reindeer Husbandry in Kautokeino will be responsible for EALÀT-outreach and communication while the Saami University College will play a lead in coordinating the research in IPY theme 6 Human society in Polar Regions. Its approach is holistic, integrating social and natural science and reindeer herders understanding in the co-production of knowledge. EALÀT will, by this means, contribute to building local competence in the indigenous peoples societies.",

On Endeavour's maiden voyage in August 1768, Cook sailed to the South Pacific (to observe and record the infrequent event of the planet Venus passing between the Earth and the sun). Determining the transit of Venus enabled early astronomers to find the distance of the sun from the Earth, which then could be used as a unit of measurement in calculating the parameters of the universe. In 1769, Cook was the first person to fully chart New Zealand (which was previously visited in 1642 by the Dutchman Abel Tasman from the Dutch province of Groningen). Cook also surveyed the eastern coast of Australia , navigated the Great Barrier Reef and traveled to Hawaii.\n\nCook's voyage on the Endeavour also established the usefulness of sending scientists on voyages of exploration. While sailing with Cook, naturalist Joseph Banks and Carl Solander collected many new families and species of plants, and encountered numerous new species of animals.\n\nEndeavour and her crew reportedly made the first long-distance voyage on which no crewman died from scurvy, the dietary disease caused by lack of ascorbic acids. Cook is credited with being the first captain to use diet as a cure for scurvy, when he made his crew eat cress, sauerkraut and an orange extract.\n\nThe Endeavour was small at about 368 tons, 100 feet in length and 20 feet in width. In contrast, its modern day namesake is 78 tons, 122 feet in length and 78 feet wide. The Endeavour of Captain Cook's day had a round bluff bow and a flat bottom. The ship's career ended on a reef along Rhode Island.\n\nFor the first time, a national competition involving students in elementary and secondary schools produced the name of the new orbiter; it was announced by President George Bush in 1989. The Space Shuttle orbiter Endeavour was delivered to Kennedy Space Center in May 1991, and flew its first mission, highlighted by the dramatic rescue of a stranded communications satellite, a year later in May 1992.\n\nIn the day-to-day world of Shuttle operations and processing, Space Shuttle orbiters go by a more prosaic designation. Endeavour is commonly refered to as OV-105, for Orbiter Vehicle-105. Empty Weight was 151,205 lbs at rollout and 172,000 lbs with main engines installed. \n\nSummary provided by http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/endeavour.html",

            "definition": "EPA's Global Change Research Program is an assessment-oriented program\nwith primary emphasis on understanding the potential consequences of\nclimate variability and change on human health, ecosystems, and\nsocioeconomic systems in the United States. This entails: (1)\nimproving the scientific basis for evaluating effects of global change\nin the context of other stressors and human dimensions (as humans are\ncatalysts of and respond to global change); (2) conducting assessments\nof the risks and opportunities presented by global change; and (3)\nassessing adaptation options to improve society's ability to\neffectively respond to the risks and opportunities presented by global\nchange as they emerge.\n\nThe program has made a major commitment to the National Assessment\nactivities organized through the USGCRP. The Global Change Research\nAct of 1990 mandates that the USGCRP conduct periodic assessments of\nthe potential consequences of global change for the United\nStates. (These periodic assessments are to be conducted not less than\nevery four years.) As a member of the USGCRP, EPA's Global Program\nwill continue to make significant contributions to the ongoing\nU.S. National Assessment Process. The EPA-sponsored assessments will\ncontinue to be conducted through public-private partnerships that\nactively engage researchers from the academic community, decision\nmakers, resource managers, and other affected stakeholders in the\nassessment process.\n\nEPA's intramural assessment program has four areas of emphasis: (1)\nhuman health; (2) air quality; (3) water quality; and (4) ecosystem\nhealth. These four focus areas are consistent with EPA's mission and\nthe strengths of EPA's research program.\n\nThe first focus area is Human Health. Since health is affected by a\nvariety of social, economic, political, environmental, and\ntechnological factors, assessing the health impacts of global change\nis a complex challenge. As a result, health assessments in EPA's\nGlobal Program go beyond basic epidemiological research to develop\nintegrated health assessment frameworks that consider the effects of\nmultiple stresses, their interactions, and human adaptive\nresponses. Along with health sector assessments conducted in\nconjunction with the USGCRP National Assessment process, there are\nresearch and assessment activities focused on the consequences of\nglobal change on weather-related morbidity and vector- and water-borne\ndiseases. In addition, the results from the Global Program's air\nquality assessments will be used to evaluate health consequences.\n\nThe second focus area is Ecosystems. The EPA's mission is not only to\nprotect human health but also to safeguard the natural\nenvironment. EPA has pledged to provide environmental protection that\n'contributes to making communities and ecosystems diverse,\nsustainable, and economically productive.' Consistent with this goal,\nEPA's Global Program is considering comprehensive ecosystem issues\nrelated to global change. Three research and assessment activities are\nplanned that evaluate the effects of global change on 1) aquatic\necosystems (which may include lakes, rivers, and streams; wetlands;\nand estuaries and coastal ecosystems); 2) invasive non-indigenous\nspecies; and 3) ecosystem services. The assessment of aquatic\necosystems will contribute to water quality assessments of pollutants\nand pathogens and of biocriteria. The ecosystem services assessment\nwill draw on work from the other ecosystem assessments.\n\nThe third focus area is Air Quality. Few studies have investigated the\neffect of global change on air quality. Given EPA's legal mandates\nwith respect to air pollution and substantial capability and expertise\nin modeling air quality and evaluating integrated response actions,\nexamining the effects of global change on air quality is a logical\nfocus of the Global Program. Assessments are planned that will examine\nthe potential consequences of global change on tropospheric ozone and\nparticulate matter. Each of these assessments is paired with a related\nhuman health assessment.\n\nThe fourth focus area is Water Quality. Water quality is affected by\nchanges in runoff following changes in precipitation and\nevapotranspiration and/or changes in land use. The program plans two\nassessments of the possible impacts of global change (climate and land\nuse change) on water quality. Both water quality assessments will\neither contribute to or benefit from human health and ecosystems\nassessments. In addition, results from the assessment of pollutants\nand microbial pathogens will be used in the assessment of biocriteria.\n\nFor more information, link to 'http://www.epa.gov/globalresearch/'",

While currently there are many different ways of\nassessing the intensity of phenomena associated with Climatic Change\n(ozone depletion, increase of temperature, CO2 and UV radiation),\nthere is no single tool for measuring the indirect effects of these\nalterations, most of which are critical to the functioning of\necosystems. In the marine environment, changes in thermal gradients\nmodify the global oceanic circulation pattern, thus bringing\nunpredictable consequences to the structure of communities, trophic\nrelationships and biogeochemical cycling. The geographic distribution\nand abundance of plankton stem from a combination of factors that\ninclude the interaction between the life cycle of species, oceanic\ncirculation, formation of eddies, the behaviour of frontal systems\n(e.g., advance and retreat of the sea-ice cover), and the abundance of\nvertebrate predators (fish, birds and marine mammals). Any alteration,\nnatural and/or anthropogenic (e.g., fisheries), in the intensity of\npredation leads to a change in the structure of trophic webs, thus\naffecting biodiversity, concentration of key Antarctic species,\nnutrient loading and carbon fluxes to the deep-sea, often resulting in\nthe general unbalance of the ecosystem. In order to examine within an\nintegral framework this conjunction of factors, the present project\nwill focus on the seasonality of one of the most peculiar areas of the\nSouthern Ocean: the Drake Passage, a key open-ocean choke point for\nthe Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The pronounced continental\nconstriction between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula causes\nthe northern deflection of the ACC and, jointly with the ENSO cycles,\ninfluences directly the Southwestern Atlantic in terms of\noceanographic-atmospheric and biological processes. Drake Bioseas is\nintended to achieve a first step towards the understanding of these\nprocesses by covering aspects that range from the assessment of\nair-sea interactions to geochronological surveys of the sea bottom,\nand from organisms living in the pelagic realm to benthic communities\nand micro-paleonthological indicators, emphasising in the\nMagellan-Antarctic regions and the Atlantic-Pacific\nconnections. Specific richness, population density, biomass and\ngeographic distribution, shifts in community structure and\nbiogeography, oxidative stress biomarkers and antioxidant defenses\nwill be examined for bacteria, protozoa, planktonic algae, meso-and\nmacrozooplankton, sea birds and marine mammals. Antarctic and\nsubantarctic fishes will be examined only as to their systematic\n(morphological and molecular) and oxidative stress; this will allow\nelucidating the patterns of distribution of key species, migration\nprocesses and physiological responses to environmental\nchanges. Special attention will be paid to dormant stages of\nmicroscopic organisms (non active bacteria, auxospore formation,\ncysts, resting propagules) as well as to factors controlling the\ntiming of activation. The role of species within the trophic web will\nbe evaluated, taking into consideration a wide spectrum of topics,\nincluding fluctuations in the nutritional mode of unicellular\norganisms, diet composition, energy content, interspecific food\noverlapping in top predators, etc. Previous information from land,\ncoastal and open ocean communities, provided from scientists involved\nin the project and by official and private institutions dedicated to\nfisheries, will constitute the tools for comparisons of past and\ncurrent conditions. Such objectives make Drake Bioseas directly link\nto CCAMLR, EBA SCAR and CAML projects. This will be the first time in\nwhich a multidisciplinary and integrated approach is made on waters of\nthe Drake Passage and its surroundings, emphasizing on the seasonal\nand inter-annual dynamics (2007-2008) of marine communities in natural\nboundaries such as Subantarctic vs. Antarctic, neritic vs. oceanic,\nPacific vs. Atlantic, summer vs. winter, low- vs. mid-latitude\nenvironments, and on trophic relationships (areas/seasons/years of\ndominance of net phytoplanktonic cells vs. DOM-based microbial food\nweb, and of crustacean vs. gelatinous zooplankton) and the magnitude\nof ecosystem fluctuations due to frontal behaviour (Subantarctic\nFront, Polar Front, Ice-Edge, winter conjunction of Polar and Ice\nfronts). Manipulative experimental work (productivity, grazing,\nphysiological responses) on board will be carried out to complement in\nsitu studies. Besides its scientific goals, the priorities of this\nendeavour embrace the legacy of an Experimental Research Centre for\nmultidisciplinary studies on cold-water organisms, and an Argentine\nicebreaker reconditioned for scientific purposes. These legacies are\nexpected to significantly contribute to the formation of a new\ngeneration of 'bio-seas' scientists.",

Proposed projects within this effort include the following:\n\nImplement the “Vital Sign” Monitoring Program for Arctic (ARCN) and Central Alaska (CAKN) Networks. These new programs, based on conceptual models and long term monitoring objectives now in development, will implement monitoring of a broad suite of biological, chemical and physical indicators on 40.6 million acres of NPS lands and waters in and around eight national park units in Alaska. Implement baseline archaeological inventories and ethnographic research: During 2007-2008 new archaeological inventories will be conducted at selected locations in Cape Krusenstern, Denali, and Yukon-Charley Rivers to locate and systematically document prehistoric human occupation sites in arctic and subarctic coastal, inland, and riverine environments. Also, ethnographic research at Yukon-Charley will synthesize oral, written and archival data to produce a comprehensive ethnographic assessment.\nReport results of the Western Airborne Contaminants Assessment Program (WACAP). During 2007-2008 this ongoing multi-regional inter-agency US program will report on airborne contaminants in arctic, subarctic, high-altitude and high latitude areas. A series of journal articles and presentations will be submitted for publication during the IPY. Results will include contaminants assessments, spring snow pack data, and atmospheric back trajectories for multiple airborne contaminants potentially affecting polar areas. A separate study will report on biological effects of airborne heavy metal deposition (mineral dust) in Cape Krusenstern.\nConvene two conferences on arctic parks and protected areas. Scientific conferences and workshops focused on science and conservation of Arctic ecosystems and cultures will be co-sponsored by NPS during the IPY. The 2007 (bilingual) conference in Chukotka will be organized with Russian cooperators through the Beringian International Heritage Program (Beringia). The 2008 symposium in Alaska will be organized with the USGS, other US cooperating agencies, and possibly Beringia program cooperators. Both symposia will be multi-disciplinary (biological, physical, cultural, and social sciences).\nFocused journal issue on climate change in Alaska’s national parks. A focused issue of the Alaska Park Science journal will be published during 2007 in both printed and web-based formats. Internet-based supporting materials, targeted to meet the curriculum requirements of middle and high-school science teachers and students, will also be developed. Issues in 2008-2009 will highlight findings from research underway during IPY.\nDigitized photo archives of arctic national parks. NPS collections of Alaska photos will be screened and a representative collection of historic photographs documenting natural and cultural resources and human activities in Alaska’s NPS areas (targeting 50-100 photographs of each area) will be digitally reproduced for use in IPY symposia and publications. This collection will also be augmented by recent photos, possibly including repeat visits to photograph and document change at the sites of historic photographs. Augment photo collection by working in cooperation with local Native residents and Native entities of the 36 neighboring communities to Arctic parks to acquire copies of historical photos documenting historical landform conditions. Obtain use permission, digitize and make available to Arctic researchers for use as dated baseline conditions.\nFocused competitive funding programs. Support for a series of new focused projects will be provided through identification and consideration of IPY-related criteria in the proposal request and evaluation processes of appropriate National Park Service competitive grant programs. Eligible activities will include research, natural and cultural resource inventories and monitoring, recording of local and traditional knowledge, trend analysis, education and public outreach in Alaska and adjacent areas of Chukotka and the Yukon Territory. For IPY 2007-2008 we will specifically invite proposals to study and inform the public about: arctic/subarctic climate change, global and local contaminants, exotic species in the arctic and subarctic, increasing human use of parks and protected areas, and resource development within and surrounding these areas.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=21",

Since a ground-based GPS receiving station is relatively inexpensive, a specially designed, dense GPS network can provide PW measurements with unprecedented coverage. Such a dataset can potentially have a significant impact on operational numerical weather prediction. In this paper, a series of numerical experiments were conducted using a variational (4DVAR) data assimilation system based on The Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research mesoscale model MM5 and its adjoint. The special soundings collected in SESAME (Severe Environmental Storms and Mesoscale Experiment) 1979 were used in two sets of experiments. In the first set, a 1-h assimilation window and an analysis of the observed PW data were used.

            "definition": "Objectives of Urban Remote Sensing\n\nRemote Sensing generally refers to the science, technology and physical processes involved in the detection, analysis and interpretation of information collected without coming into physical contact with the object of interest. In the context of our research and applications, urban remote sensing focuses primarily on understanding the physical properties and processes of urban environments and on the mapping and monitoring of urban land cover and spatial extent. These two objectives are related in the sense that it is necessary to understand the physical properties of the urban mosaic in order to rigorously define, map and monitor urban areas.\n\nCharacterizing the Physical Properties of the Urban Environment\n\nThe research presented here is primarily focused on the physical properties of a wide range of urban environments using passive measurement of optical reflectance and thermal emission as well as optical emission of nighttime lights. Comparative analyses of urban reflectance (visible and infrared color) and surface temperature allow us to develop robust criteria for distinguishing urban land cover from non-anthropogenic land covers. These analyses also provide important constraints on the physical properties that control mass and energy fluxes through the urban environment. These constraints are used as inputs to physical models of climatic, hydrologic and ecologic processes.\n\nMapping and Monitoring Urban Form and Growth\n\nCharacterizing the physical properties of urban land cover makes it possible to map the form and spatial extent of urban land use and to quantify changes in form and extent. This provides objective, physically-based metrics for comparative analyses of urban dynamics that cannot generally be obtained from administrative definitions of urban extent. Mapping provides static snapshots of the urban mosaic while monitoring allows us to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics. Mapping urban extent with nightlights complements the information derived from optical reflectance.\n\nEach city is linked to a jpeg image of a Landsat visible/IR composite collected by Landsat 5 (pre 1999) or Landsat 7. Most of the image areas are 30x30 km but a few are larger. All images are shown at full resolution (30 m pixel) so the scale (on screen) is equivalent. The jpeg compression causes significant loss of fine detail from the original image. Most of the images are about 200K (~40 seconds via 56K modem). A few are significantly larger.",

To main factors forming the climate of the Spitsbergen Archipelago one could refer its geographical location, atmospheric circulation, ocean impact, sea and continental ice sheet, complicated morphometrics.\nOn the Spitsbergen Archipelago there exists the huge mass of fresh water in a form of cryosphere elements (glaciers, snow cover, naleds), it has a specific biota and at the same time locates in the area of a relatively intensive economic activity compared with other Arctic Archipelagos... Thus, Cryosphere, Hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere of the Archipelago is a noticeable objects-indicator of the current status of the Arctic climate system and estimates of its future changes. Along with this Spitsbergen is a wonderful science platform for studying the overall spectrum of reactions of Polar Regions nature on the climate variations both of natural and anthropogenic origin.\nNowadays, a large complex of scientific researches and monitoring of the Spitsbergen Archipelago environment is carried out on the basis of the infrastructure of the Russian village Barents burg, Norwegian villages Longierbuen and New-Alesunn and also the Polish research base Hornsunn. Meteorological, aerological, ice, oceanographic, biological and other observations are performed.\nIt is considered to perform the following complex investigations of the Spitsbergen Archipelago environment in the framework of this project:\nMain project goals are: \n- development and unification of the existing system of complex monitoring of the principal climate forming parameters of the environment status in the area of the Spitsbergen Archipelago \nestimation of the features of the present status of the principal components of the climatic and systems of the Archipelago and surrounding Euro-Arctic aquatic regions -on the basis of the analysis of databases obtained during the project implementation and historical Russian and available international databases ;\nUnderstanding of the impact mechanisms of external climate factors on the nature of the Spitsbergen Archipelago;\ndevelopment of the scientific basis of the scenarios of possible climate changes of the Archipelago environment and forecast of possible ecological impact;\n- improvement of the technology and technical means for the system of hydrometeorological monitoring of the environment.\nThe investigations are complex ones. So, there are some separate sub-programs co-operating in the framework of general research program including the following directions:\n-Meteorological regime;\n-Hydrological regime of dry land;\n-Energy-exchange processes between the atmosphere and underlying surface;\n-Ice-cover evolution;\n-Structure and dynamics of coastal waters including fiords; \n-Climate and fresh water balance;\n-Sea-ice evolution; \n- Monitoring of contamination of air and water ambience\n-Studies of the composite and concentration of radio-active gases in the atmosphere and ocean;\n-Flora and fauna research;\n-Validation of results from remote sounding of the environment components;\n-Testing and experimental service of new measurement complexes for the Archipelago environment monitoring. \nImplementation of the above sub-programs will be realized on the basis of ZGMO «Baretsburg» (AARI, Murmansk ASMS), Norwegian research station in New Alesunn village (NPI) and Polish station in the Hornsunn Bay (Polish Academy of Sciences). Also it is assumed to perform, on the basis of the previous AARI field studies on the Archipelago, the constant-basis observations at a number of geographical objects (glaciers, lakes, river valleys, etc) for which there exist multi-year sets of field data. Here we suppose to use both automation measuring complexes and random observations using helicopters, sea- vehicles etc.",

They were obtained from meteorological stations placed Saint Peter Peter and Saint Paul Rocks (SPP) (1°N, 29°W) and at the top of a surface buoy moored in the Gulf of Guinea (0°N, 4°W). From the wind observations the wind stress was inferred, and results are compared with climatology. The wind stress time series show the abrupt increase of the winds during the spring that, at SPP, reaches a value as high as 0.35 dyn/cm2 in 2 weeks for both observed years. The 11-day running mean time series shows that the onset of the zonal component of the wind stress occurs at SPP on April 10, 1983, and on May 17, 1984, and in the Gulf of Guinea (GG) on April 5, 1983, and April 10, 1984. The monthly mean observations show an interannual variability both in the time of the onset and in the strength of the trade winds. At SPP and GG the total wind stress increases 1 month earlier than climatology in 1983 but at the same time as climatology in 1984. At SPP the zonal component of the wind stress also intensifies 1 month earlier than climatology in 1983 but 1 month later in 1984. The equatorial temperature records at 28°W and 4°W show that the depth of the 20°C isotherm, on a seasonal time scale, decreases during the relaxation period of the trade winds (boreal winter). In 1983-1984 this occurred in December 1983 at 28°W and in March 1984 at 4°W. After the onset of the local trade winds, the thermocline continues to move upward during 1 month at 28°W and during 3 months at 4°W thereafter, the thermocline deepens at both locations. At the surface, the temperature decreases when the trade winds intensify and remains low as long as the trade winds are blowing. The seasonal variations of the temperature both at the surface and below the surface at 28°W and 4°W are interpreted in the light of the results of a nonlinear multilevel model in the cases of a sudden increase and a sudden relaxation of the trade winds. \n\nInformation provided by http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987JGR....92.3741C",

            "definition": "The evolution of stratospheric ozone and other important and related atmospheric constituents in Polar Regions is tightly coupled to a wide range of processes acting within and outside the winter polar vortices and through the entire region from the surface to the mesopause. Much of the current understanding of these processes has been achieved within the programme of SPARC (Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate), a WCRP core project, and other international projects with which it maintains collaborative links. The IPY programme offers a unique opportunity for SPARC to assemble a range of scientific expertise to study the Antarctic and Arctic Polar Vortices, the loci of key chemical and physical processes associated with ozone depletion and its eventual recovery, as well as of key features of the dynamical coupling between the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere in polar and sub-polar regions. The central goal of the SPARC IPY programme (hereinafter referred to as SPARC-IPY) is to document as completely as possible the dynamics and chemistry of the polar vortices and physical properties relevant to processes such as the formation of polar stratospheric clouds. To achieve this detailed picture and yield a unique synthesis of data on the polar middle atmosphere, SPARC-IPY will facilitate analysis of available research and operational satellite data, as well as ground-based and aircraft data, and encourage work on data assimilation and inter-comparison of assimilated data sets. This will include data from new measurement systems as well as from enhanced measurement programmes with established systems. To complement results provided by new measurement programmes, weather services carrying out routine radiosonde and ozonesonde measurements will be encouraged to increase the frequency of the observations and to store the data with full resolution. As the lead organization, the SPARC Project will coordinate the SPARC-IPY programme, promote specific new initiatives and organize workshops and meetings to facilitate research and dissemination of results. These efforts will be carried out in the context of the SPARC Project core thematic programmes of Stratospheric Chemistry and Climate; Stratosphere-Troposphere Dynamical Coupling; and Detection, Attribution, and Prediction of Stratospheric Change. SPARC-IPY is the lead EoI for sub-cluster 7.1 (IPY SPARC). The EoIs that are clustered within this proposal will constitute key components of this programme (consortium members are listed in section 4.2) which will include the following specific components: (a) An Arctic measurement programme will document the “state of the Arctic middle atmosphere” during the IPY (EoI 11, PASSMeC). This will use data from ground based and satellite systems, centered on four lidar systems located at sites across the Arctic. These lidar measurements will be coordinated with satellite and radiosonde/ozonesonde measurements. These lidars are distributed under different regimes of the Arctic middle atmosphere and provide measurements that are critical for understanding the role of tides, planetary and gravity waves in the large-scale circulation. (b) A data assimilation, modelling and analysis component will focus on assimilation and analysis of these observations to yield a comprehensive picture of the observed circulation and facilitate prediction of changes in the circulation and associated physical and chemical responses. In addition this component will include archival of assimilation products (analyses and forecasts) arising from participating middle atmosphere assimilation groups during the IPY period. Such products will be routinely produced at weather forecast centers using models with vertical domains that extend above the stratopause. Research groups employing chemistry transport models or chemistry climate models will also participate. These activities are critical for understanding the structure and evolution of the Arctic vortex, the formation of polar stratospheric clouds, the depletion of ozone, and the initiation of anomalous weather regimes associated with the Arctic Oscillation. A specific component activity will include analysis of the dynamics and chemistry associated with Stratospheric Sudden Warmings (SSWs) in the Arctic Polar atmosphere during the IPY (EoI 959, CMAM-IPY). The Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM), which extends from the ground to above the mesopause and includes comprehensive and coupled chemistry, radiation and dynamics, will be used to analyse SSWs during the IPY using a 3D-Var data assimilation scheme. (c) Data available from instruments in operation at different Antarctic and relevant continental sub polar sites in the southern tip of South America, where the Antarctic polar vortex/ozone hole system passes over inhabited regions, in combination with satellite data. will be collected and interpreted. Organization of special campaign periods will be promoted in collaboration with the various national agencies involved in the operation of these sites. CTM runs of relevant events using the AMR-CTM with the MECCA/MESSY chemistry module (Argentina/UK/Germany) will be carried out. The SPARC-IPY programme will also link with other closely related IPY activities (see section 3.5). The services of the SPARC Data Center will be made available to facilitate acquisition and archiving of key data that will be used for projects or generated by them during the IPY period (see section 3.6).\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=217",

Much\nof the current understanding of these processes has been achieved\nwithin the programme of SPARC (Stratospheric Processes and their Role\nin Climate), a WCRP core project, and other international projects\nwith which it maintains collaborative links. The IPY programme offers\na unique opportunity for SPARC to assemble a range of scientific\nexpertise to study the Antarctic and Arctic Polar Vortices, the loci\nof key chemical and physical processes associated with ozone depletion\nand its eventual recovery, as well as of key features of the dynamical\ncoupling between the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere in\npolar and sub-polar regions. The central goal of the SPARC IPY\nprogramme (hereinafter referred to as SPARC-IPY) is to document as\ncompletely as possible the dynamics and chemistry of the polar\nvortices and physical properties relevant to processes such as the\nformation of polar stratospheric clouds. To achieve this detailed\npicture and yield a unique synthesis of data on the polar middle\natmosphere, SPARC-IPY will facilitate analysis of available research\nand operational satellite data, as well as ground-based and aircraft\ndata, and encourage work on data assimilation and inter-comparison of\nassimilated data sets. This will include data from new measurement\nsystems as well as from enhanced measurement programmes with\nestablished systems. To complement results provided by new measurement\nprogrammes, weather services carrying out routine radiosonde and\nozonesonde measurements will be encouraged to increase the frequency\nof the observations and to store the data with full resolution. As the\nlead organization, the SPARC Project will coordinate the SPARC-IPY\nprogramme, promote specific new initiatives and organize workshops and\nmeetings to facilitate research and dissemination of results. These\nefforts will be carried out in the context of the SPARC Project core\nthematic programmes of Stratospheric Chemistry and Climate;\nStratosphere-Troposphere Dynamical Coupling; and Detection,\nAttribution, and Prediction of Stratospheric Change. SPARC-IPY is the\nlead EoI for sub-cluster 7.1 (IPY SPARC). The EoIs that are clustered\nwithin this proposal will constitute key components of this programme\n(consortium members are listed in section 4.2) which will include the\nfollowing specific components: (a) An Arctic measurement programme\nwill document the state of the Arctic middle atmosphere\nduring the IPY (EoI 11, PASSMeC). This will use data from ground based\nand satellite systems, centered on four lidar systems located at sites\nacross the Arctic. These lidar measurements will be coordinated with\nsatellite and radiosonde/ozonesonde measurements. These lidars are\ndistributed under different regimes of the Arctic middle atmosphere\nand provide measurements that are critical for understanding the role\nof tides, planetary and gravity waves in the large-scale\ncirculation. (b) A data assimilation, modelling and analysis component\nwill focus on assimilation and analysis of these observations to yield\na comprehensive picture of the observed circulation and facilitate\nprediction of changes in the circulation and associated physical and\nchemical responses. In addition this component will include archival\nof assimilation products (analyses and forecasts) arising from\nparticipating middle atmosphere assimilation groups during the IPY\nperiod. Such products will be routinely produced at weather forecast\ncenters using models with vertical domains that extend above the\nstratopause. Research groups employing chemistry transport models or\nchemistry climate models will also participate. These activities are\ncritical for understanding the structure and evolution of the Arctic\nvortex, the formation of polar stratospheric clouds, the depletion of\nozone, and the initiation of anomalous weather regimes associated with\nthe Arctic Oscillation. A specific component activity will include\nanalysis of the dynamics and chemistry associated with Stratospheric\nSudden Warmings (SSWs) in the Arctic Polar atmosphere during the IPY\n(EoI 959, CMAM-IPY). The Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM),\nwhich extends from the ground to above the mesopause and includes\ncomprehensive and coupled chemistry, radiation and dynamics, will be\nused to analyse SSWs during the IPY using a 3D-Var data assimilation\nscheme. (c) Data available from instruments in operation at different\nAntarctic and relevant continental sub polar sites in the southern tip\nof South America, where the Antarctic polar vortex/ozone hole system\npasses over inhabited regions, in combination with satellite\ndata. will be collected and interpreted. Organization of special\ncampaign periods will be promoted in collaboration with the various\nnational agencies involved in the operation of these sites. CTM runs\nof relevant events using the AMR-CTM with the MECCA/MESSY chemistry\nmodule (Argentina/UK/Germany) will be carried out. The SPARC-IPY\nprogramme will also link with other closely related IPY activities\n(see section 3.5). The services of the SPARC Data Center will be made\navailable to facilitate acquisition and archiving of key data that\nwill be used for projects or generated by them during the IPY period\n(see section 3.6).",

In 1994, in response to the science proposal to complete the CASERTZ corridors, the National Science Foundation&#039;s Office of Polar Programs requested that the aircraft and its integrated instrumentation package be operated as a facility with a mission of providing aerogeophysical observations to the broader Antarctic science community. This request led to a Cooperative Agreement between UTIG and NSF that created the Support Office for Aerogeophysical Research (SOAR).\nThe SOAR Mission\nThe six-year Cooperative Agreement defined UTIG&#039;s responsibilities as:\n\n\n-Assisting in the development of aerogeophysical research projects with NSF/OPP investigators\n\n-Upgrading the CASERTZ instrumentation package to accommodate new science projects and advances in technology;  fielding this instrument package to accomplish SOAR developed projects\n\n-Distribution of the acquired aerogeophysical data as spatially organized transects to the Project Investigators within six months of its return from the field.\n\nAn option was included for SOAR to reduce and analyze the aerogeophysical data that it collected for members of the scientific community without that capacity.\n\nSOAR Accomplishments\nBeginning in 1994, UTIG conducted aerogeophysical surveys in seven consecutive Antarctic field seasons. These SOAR-developed surveys were performed for the 20 investigators and 14 institutions listed in Table 1. The first six of these seasons were managed under the NSF/UTIG Cooperative Agreement with D. Blankenship as PI; the last, 2000/2001, was managed as a multi-investigator grant to UTIG with D. Blankenship, J. Holt, D. Morse and I. Dalziel as co PI&#039;s. To accomplish these surveys, UTIG configured the integrated instrumentation package and installed it in the aircraft on site in Antarctica each season; additionally, base camp operations were established at up to five remote sites each field season. In total, UTIG conducted an additional 225,000 line kilometers of aerogeophysical surveys in 422 flights covering the areas shown in the Figure. The spatially organized database of geophysical transects was delivered to the various investigators within the targeted six-month time frame.\n\nInformation provided by http://www.ig.utexas.edu/research/projects/soar/",

            "definition": "The measurement of sea level along polar coastlines presents great technical challenges for the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) of the WMO/IOC Joint Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM). The need for measurements in these data sparse regions has been clearly made in the scientific literature. For example, in oceanography, Arctic sea level data presently available suggest a common-mode of variability which provides insights in the quasi-resonant dynamics of the Arctic Ocean. Arctic sea level data are of particular interest within water balance studies concerning the freshening of the Arctic Ocean and its relationship to the Arctic Oscillation. Antarctic sea level changes have also been found to demonstrate considerable coherence related to the Southern Annular Mode and transports in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The need for measurements for climate studies by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has also been clearly made. Monitoring of levels in both high-latitude regions is necessary to understand more completely the spatial pattern of long term sea level change due to ocean warming and ice melt. Climate and sea level changes also affect the stability of ice shelves and fast ice and the glaciers behind them.This project will use existing and new Arctic sea level recorders (there are no sites currently operational in Greenland, for example) and will make enhancements to the existing network of gauges in Antarctica. Past and future tide gauge data sets will be used in combination with satellite altimeter and space gravity data where possible to understand further the regional ocean dynamics and climate change (EoI 580). Differences between Arctic and Antarctic in ocean dynamics and sea level response to climate change are particularly interesting. The new recorders will be high technology devices providing data at high frequency and real time, comprising the core of ongoing polar sea level monitoring networks. This will be an essential component of GLOSS and a major legacy of IPY (EoI 211).\nBenefits from enhanced polar networks can be anticipated in many ways not yet clear. However, sea level data are indispensable in many countries for practical applications such as flood warning, navigation, civil engineering and environmental monitoring, in addition to their scientific applications. Consequently, Arctic communities can be expected to benefit from investment in this collaborative sea level research. For example, the GREENSEAL project (EoI 761) will focus on developing the GLOSS network in Greenland which will benefit Arctic ocean circulation and sea ice flow studies, as well as providing essential practical data sets to local communities. The LEVANS project (EoI 304) will enhance corresponding data sets and understanding in Nordic Seas, while the Russian Arctic networks project (EoI 732) will see similar benefits to Russian science and coastal communities.\nThe further understanding of ocean tides in polar regions is a particularly important component of sea level studies, being relevant to a range of geophysical (e.g. dissipation), physical oceanographic (mixing), glaciological (sea ice formation) and biological studies (EoI 590). High latitude bathymetry and sub-ice-shelf topography are needed in addition to tidal measurements from coastal and bottom tide gauges and (where possible) altimetry over ocean and ice-shelves.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=13",

The extraordinary tusk defies most of the principles and properties of teeth and remains a scientific enigma. Findings about its form and function will add to the evolutionary knowledge for this odd adaptation and will, because of unique findings of anatomy and histology recently discovered by this team, further define sensory capabilities of mammalian teeth. Scientific results have already begun to direct interest in future models of dental material design as the hard tissue of the narwhal tusk possesses a combination of unusual flexibility and strength characteristics that is highly desirable in restorative materials. These same tusk traits were observed by the Inuit before the laboratory testing was completed, and the results were reported. Likewise, traditional knowledge elucidates many aspects of narwhal anatomy, function, migration and social behavior. Both the knowledge of Inuit elders and the findings of scientists are needed for a more complete understanding of the narwhal, Qilalugaq qernertaq.\n\nScientific studies in anatomy, morphology, histology, physiology, genetics, cellular biology and narwhal social behavior are currently being conducted by the principal investigator and collaborators to elucidate tusk function. Anatomical variations of narwhal will be described from field and laboratory dissection, computerized scans (CT, MRI and micro-CT), analysis of museum specimens, and interviews with Inuit elders. Photographic morpho-metric analysis of narwhal skeletal collections at the Museum of Nature in Canada, Zoological Museum, University of Copenhagen, the Smithsonian Institution and the American Museum of Natural History has been initiated, and we are seeking other institutions that may have additional collections, particularly those with rare specimens.

Since then, a vast amount of new data was accumulated in high latitudes, especially in their oceanic parts and continent-to-ocean transition zones where extensive geophysical and geological studies were accompanied by over-ice, submarine and ship-borne hydrographic surveys. On land the principal achievements were provided by modern isotope geochemistry methods that enabled better insight in crust-mantle relationships and improved dating of the earliest stages of geological history. As the result, a considerable progress in understanding the tectonic evolution of the Polar Regions was made, and at the same time new challenges for the future research came in sight. In particular, it became evident that conventional models of continent separation and sea floor spreading which could successfully be applied for Gondwana break-up and accompanying formation of the Southern Ocean were meeting serious difficulties in the North where their implementation appeared severely constrained by strong internal heterogeneity of the Arctic Ocean.\nPortraying the antipodal structures of the Arctic and the Antarctic and analyzing the resemblances and dissimilarities in their tectonic frameworks and histories will not only have a fundamental importance for global geodynamics but also contribute significantly to climate change research through improving knowledge of evolution of the Polar oceans and formation of seaways. The educational value of the project will arise from presentation in a condensed form of a variety of earth science data ranging from sub-aerial, sub-ice and submarine topography to configuration of the base of the Earth's crust, and from genetic classification of the major structural assemblages and features to their spatial distribution and reflection in potential fields. The final maps will be presented at 1:10,000,000 scales (with supplementary smaller scale insets) in a circum-polar projection encompassing the area to 60o N/S.\nThe main objectives of the project include: (1) Integrating abundant Arctic and Antarctic geological data and tectonic interpretations disseminated in multinational literature into a coherent generalized legend that would allow the presentation of principal structural elements and historical particularities of both Polar Regions in a unified system of graphical designations and basic terms; (2) Compiling 1:10 M maps and smaller scale insets; (3) Preparing textual supplements to the cartographic products in the form of a short booklet and more extensive explanatory notes highlighting the tectonic essentialities of the Polar Regions in a comparative context; (4) Producing the first printed products by the time of 33rd Session of IGC (Oslo, 2008) and within the scope of IPY activities.\nAchieving project goals will require participation of many countries, organizations and individuals. Adequate coordination and scientific guidance of project activities will be provided by CGMW.\nThe project is planned as a dedicated indoor effort not requiring special field expeditions and utilizing predominantly the already existing voluminous data. Additional new evidence relevant for the project purposes may, however, be readily assimilated from any 2006-2007 field activity executed by partner countries either on national basis, or within the IPY framework.",

            "definition": "The Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) rift-flank uplift has developed along the ancestral margin of the East Antarctic craton, and forms the boundary between the craton and the thinned lithosphere of the West Antarctic rift system. Geodynamic processes associated with the exceptionally large-magnitude uplift of the mountain belt remain poorly constrained, but may involve interaction of rift-related mechanical and thermal processes and the inherited mechanical elements of the cratonic lithosphere. The Transantarctic Mountain Aerogeophysical Research Activities (TAMARA) program proposes to document the regional structural architecture of a key segment of the Transantarctic Mountains in the region around the Royal Society Range (Fig. 1) where the rift flank is offset along a transverse accommodation zone. In December through January, 1998, the TAMARA group flew a helicopter aeromagnetic survey and collected ground gravity station data. These data will be integrated with other geologic and geophysical information from the region in order to map the large-scale structures along the TAM where relations between longitudinal and transverse structures along the rift flank can be resolved. \n\nDuring the 1997-1998 field season, the TAMARA project collected about 14,100 line-km of helicopter magnetic data, covering an area just a little less than 30,000 km2 (Fig. 2).  One hundred twenty-five hours of helicopter time were used to complete the survey. Relative to the initial plans, 92.5% of line-kilometers, or 95% of the planned area, was covered. \n\nMagnetic base stations established in McMurdo and the Skelton Neve field camp recorded the daily variations of Earth&#039;s magnetic field for removal from the total-field observed from the helicopter. The position of a cesium magnetometer carried in a bird slung 30 m below the helicopter was accomplished with Trimble 4000 GPS receivers. Barometric altitudes were also recorded. The data from each flight were quality controlled. \n\nThe crew for the aeromagnetic helicopter-borne program consisted of 3 helicopter support personnel (including 2 pilots and an engineer) and 6 scientific staff (geophysicists, engineers, and quality control specialists). Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe (BGR) contributed a geophysicist, an engineer, and a quality control specialist. Three additional scientists were from the USGS and Ohio State University. A general assistant for camp operations and a mountaineer were supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF). \n\nIn addition to the aeromagnetic data, 65 gravity stations were collected in profile-form in the Skelton Neve region. \n\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 9618568. \n\nAny opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. \n\nThis information is provided by http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2002/ofr-02-452/t_desc.html",

            "definition": "In order to better understand the tropical ocean/atmosphere system and\nits effect on the climate at higher latitudes, the Tropical Ocean and\nGlobal Atmosphere (TOGA) Program was initiated in 1985 by the World\nMeteorological Organization (WMO), with contributions from nations\nincluding the USA, UK, USSR, Japan, Australia, India and Chile.  TOGA\nwas a major component of the WMO's World Climate Research Program\n(WCRP) and was effective in bringing together the international\nscientific research community to work on problems of global\nsignificance.  Scientific oversight was provided by the TOGA\nScientific Steering Group who reports to the Joint Scientific\nCommittee of WCRP.  International coordination was organized through\nthe International TOGA Project Office in Geneva and the 18-member\nIntergovernmental TOGA Board.\n\nThe U.S.  contribution to TOGA involved the National Oceanic\nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Science Foundation (NSF),\nand the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  NOAA\ninvolvement includes the Climate Analysis Center (CAC), NOAA\nEnvironmental Research Laboratories (Pacific Marine Environmental\nLaboratory (PMEL), Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological\nLaboratory (AOML), Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), and\nthe Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL), and the\nNational Oceanographic Service (NOS).  NSF support was funded\nthrough its Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences Divisions and through NCAR.\nNASA's effort was funded to NASA centers and academic principal\ninvestigators while the Office of Naval Research (ONR) supports a\nnumber of university scientists.\n\nTOGA is a 10-year international program that began January 1, 1985 and\ncontinued through 1994.\n\nThe major elements of the TOGA Praogram Plan are modeling, empirical\nstudies, process studies and long-term observations.  Three types of\nmodels are being used: (1) oceanographic models, in which the wind\nstress and heat flux at the air-sea interface are prescribed and the\ntime-dependent response of the upper layers of the tropical ocean is\nsimulated; (2) atmospheric models, in which the global circulation is\nsimulated given various prescriptions of the tropical SST field; and\n(3) coupled atmosphere-ocean models, which are integrated forward in\ntime from a prescribed set of initial conditions.  Empirical studies\nare focusing on interannual and intraseasonal variability along with\nstatistical analyses of lead-lag relationships that may have relevance\nto seasonal climate prediction.  Long-term observations include\ninterfacial measurements, and atmospheric and oceanographic\nobservations.\n\nScience Objective:\n-To gain a description of the tropical oceans and the global atmosphere as a\n time-dependent system, in order to determine the extent to which this system\n is predictable on time scales of months to years, and to understand the\n mechanisms and processes underlying that predictability.\n-To study the feasibility of modeling the coupled ocean-atmosphere system for\n the purpose of predicting its variations on time scales of months to years.\n-To provide the scientific background for designing an observing and data\n transmission system for operational prediction if this capability is\n demonstrated by coupled ocean-atmosphere models.\n\n\nData Used and Produced:\nLong-term monitoring is among the more focused of the program elements\nof TOGA.  It is a prerequisite for numerical simulation and long-term\nprediction of the coupled climate system, and it supports process and\nempirical studies.  Interfacial measurements such as wind stress, sea\nsurface temperature (SST) and surface energy fluxes are most central\nto the ocean-atmosphere coupling and are attaining the highest\npriority.  The major sources of surface wind data over the tropical\noceans are moored buoys, ships of opportunity and island stations.\nThe moored buoys transmit wind, air temperature, SST and subsurface\ntemperature via the ARGOS/TIROS-N system.  Wind observations from\nships and island stations are transmitted via the Global\nTelecommunication System (GTS).  The CAC has been producing monthly\nmean SST analyses with about 2 degree spatial resolution, based upon a\nblend of in situ (ship and buoy) data and Advanced Very High\nResolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data, while also monitoring\nnet energy flux monthly mean fields generated by one of the\noperational numerical weather prediction models at the National\nMeteorological Center (NMC).\n\nObservations of the global atmosphere in suapport of TOGA relied\nheavily on the World Weather Watch/Global Telecommunications System\n(WWW/GTS).  The observing network consists of two polar-orbiting\nsatellites and the full array of geostationary satellites, ships of\nopportunity, buoys, and surface and upper-air stations.  The Global\nPrecipitation Center at CAC has been supportive in producing\npreliminary estimates of tropical convective precipitation from\n1986-1988 based on satellite imagery from the U.S., Japan and the\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA) geostationary satellites.  Ships of\nopportunity and approximately 50 drifting buoys are being used to\nmeasure sea level pressure, air temperature and SST over data-sparse\nregions of the equatorial and extratropical South Pacific.  The\nNational Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and ERL have\ncontributed some upper-air systems and Doppler profilers to the\nsurface and upper-air network.\n\nThe ocean observing system consisted of tidal gauges, satellite data,\nmoored (ATLAS) and drifting (Langrangian) buoys and and ships of\nopportunity.  The island tide gauge network along with altimetric\nrange data obtained from military satellites provided sea level data.\nExpendable Bathythermograph System (XBT) lines from ships provided\nsoundings to analyze the thermal structure and the heat content. Ships\nalso carried out conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) surveys in\nthe upper 1000m of the ocean.  Moored buoys, instrumented with current\nmeters and thermistor chains also provided subsurface thermal\nstructure and current data.  Circulation was measured utilizing\nequatorial moorings and from a field of over 130 mixed-layer\nLangrangian drifters.\n\nThe following sites on the World Wide Web can provide further information\nas well as data access:\n     TOGA COARE Data Information System\n                   'http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/coare/'\n     TOGA-TAO Realtime Data Access:\n                   'http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/'\n\nReferences:\n     National Research Council, 'TOGA, A Review of Progress and Future\n     Opportunities', National Academy Press 1990.\n\n     World Meteorological Organization, 'WMO/IOC Inter-governmental TOGA Board\n     Report of the Third Session, Geneva, 9-12 January 1990', WMO/TD No. 357.\n\n     World Meteorological Organization, 'JSC/CCCO TOGA Scientific Steering\n     Group Report of the Eighth Session, Hamburg, 18-22 September 1989',\n     WMO/TD No. 338.",

Text in original form for archival purposes.]\n\n\nTerraSAR-X (TSX), the first German long-duration radar mission, is being realized in the frame of a public-private partnership between the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and Astrium GmbH. The spacecraft will carry as primary instrument an X-band imaging system and a high-performance antenna system, enabling different operational modes. The spacecraft will be injected into a sun-synchronous, circular dusk-dawn orbit at approximately 514 km altitude. The launch is foreseen for mid 2005 from the cosmodrome Baikonur. The mission is designed for a five year lifetime. The satellite payload will generate and down-link X-band SAR raw data, which will be processed on ground to generate X-band SAR basic products. Both partners will use SAR data and basic products for their respective fields of interest, DLR for standard science applications, Astrium for the commercial market. TSX SAR data for the science community will be made available by the DLR CAF in Oberpfaffenhofen. GFZ Potsdam and the CSR in Austin are collaborating in providing a precise dual frequency GPS flight receiver to the mission to enhance the quality of the scientific SAR products. GFZ Potsdam, the CSR in Austin and the Technical University Berlin are in particular interested and will collaborate in the precision processing of TerraSAR-X SAR data for environmental, geophysical and hydrological investigations.  In view of the extensive scientific interest in the multi-mode X-Band SAR data from the TerraSAR-X mission and in view of the great importance the accurate orbit ephemeris information has for all application modes, it is proposed that GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ) in collaboration with the University of Texas Center for Space Research (CSR) provides a Tracking, Occultation and Ranging (TOR) instrument package, consisting of an experimental IGOR-class high-quality GPS tracking receiver and a CHAMP-class laser retroreflector set, and the necessary support for the integration of the instrument package aboard the TSX spacecraft, GFZ and CSR jointly verify the in-orbit performance of the flight receiver and laser retroreflector data and compute high-precision TSX orbits from the validated TOR package data in order to enhance the efficiency of the SAR data processing and the quality of the SAR data products, GFZ and CSR both collect atmospheric and ionospheric radio occultation (RO) data with the same IGOR receiver for augmenting the global RO data sets as obtained from other LEO satellites (CHAMP and GRACE) to be used for improvements of numerical weather forecasts, climate change studies and space weather monitoring. Derived fundamental atmospheric and ionospheric quantities (e.g. temperature, water vapor) will be used as complementary information for SAR error correction. GFZ, CSR and the Technical University Berlin (TUB) Institute for Photogrammetry and Cartography use the resulting high quality orbit and atmospheric correction products in conjunction with DLR-provided TSX-X band SAR data for the regions specified in B.1.2.3 for improved scientific analyses. As mentioned before, the primary scientific applications are monitoring the evolution of city surface subsidence, to monitor and model local geologic hazards such as landslides and rock falls and to assess the impact of ice sheet and glacier system dynamics.",

As in the past, the Columbia University SRP includes a unique balance of highly integrated  biomedical and non-biomedical research.\n\nAs indicated in the list on below, the program includes three biomedical research projects, intimately intertwined with three non-biomedical projects; these projects are supported by research support cores. An Administrative Core is responsible for the supervision, coordination, and financial accountability of the entire SRP. The Research Translation Core 'Collaborating with Government & the Public: As & Mn Exposure via Groundwater' provides additional mechanisms for sustained communications among the SRP research projects, cores, government agencies, and interested parties. The RTC also helps government agencies and the public evaluate and address local groundwater contamination by providing geospatial data integration, mapping, and field assistance. Finally, the newly created SRP Community Engagement Core aims to reduce health risks of residents in Maine who rely on domestic wells for water supply and who are exposed to arsenic, and other contaminants including radon (Rn), uranium (U) and manganese (Mn).\n\nFor more information, please visit: http://superfund.ciesin.columbia.edu/niehsWeb/index.jsp",

Acoustic noise monitoring and the study of its variations as a function of time is a useful research tool to study marine environment and evaluate the “health of seas”.\n\nSince about ten years, scientists from three Italian Institues INFN, INGV, CIBRA, and University “Sapienza” of Roma, carry out acoustic monitoring of sea with a new methodology: the installation of submarine microphones (hydrophones) antenna in deep sea, more than 2000 m water depth, off Eastern Sicilian Coast. These antennas detect acoustic signals that, using optical fibre cables, are continuously transmitted to shore where they are recorded and analyses. This experimental technique, developed by INFN to permit identification of subatomic particle (neutrinos) of astrophysical origin, has important follow-up in biology and geophysics.\n\nThe SMO Collaboiration, formed by INFN, University Sapienza of Rome, University Roma 3, INGV, and CIBRA is building a new acoustic antenna to be deployed at 3500 m water depth, off Capo Passero (South East Sicily) to study, with sensitive acoustic devices, deep sea sounds.",

Many mechanisms have been proposed, ranging from delayed phase changes to transform-flank uplift, all of which make various assumptions about upper mantle structure beneath and adjacent to the rift-side of the mountain front.\n\nThe structure of the East Antarctic Craton. East Antarctica displays the greatest modal elevation of any major cratonic block when corrected for glacial loading. The anomalous elevation of East Antarctica may have been an important factor in the onset of continental glaciation. However, the support mechanism for this anomalous topography is unknown; possible models include isostatic uplift from (a) thickened crust, (b) anomalously depleted upper mantle, and (c) thermally modified upper mantle, as well as dynamic uplift. The lateral extent of the very old continental lithosphere is also uncertain. In particular, it is unknown whether the old lithosphere extends to the western edge of East Antarctica beneath the crustal rocks deformed during the Ross Orogeny. \nTo examine details of the crust and upper mantle structure across the East-West Antarctic boundary, this passive seismic experiment is comprised of three elements: (1) A 1400 km linear array of 17 broadband seismic stations extending from the high central regions of the East Antarctic craton to the Transantarctic Mountains (Array 1). (2) An intersecting 400 km linear array of 16 broadband seismic stations extending from the coast across the Transantarctic mountains nearly perpendicular to the strike of the range in the dry valleys region (Array 2). (3) An array of 11 broadband stations in coastal regions around Ross Island and Terra Nova Bay (Array 3).\n\nThis experiment will be conducted over a three-year period, to allow sufficient data collection from naturally occurring earthquakes, and will begin in November 2000. Airborne surveys for surface elevation and ice thickness will be completed in support of this work. If feasible, aerogravity and aeromagnetics data will also be collected. Data will be analyzed using a variety of proven modeling techniques, including body and surface wave tomography, receiver function inversion, and shear wave splitting analysis. The results of these analyses will be maps of the variation in crustal thickness, upper mantle structure, anisotropy, and mantle discontinuity topography across the boundary of East and West Antarctica. These results will provide a solid foundation for understanding the geodynamics of the Antarctic continent.\n\nInformation provided by http://epsc.wustl.edu/seismology/TAMSEIS/summary.html",

This signing was in accordance with the general\nagreement between the U.S. Government and the Government of the\nPRC on Cooperation in Science and Technology that was signed in\nWashington, D.C., in January 1979, and extended by agreement in\nJanuary 1984. In April 1990, the Protocol was extended for 1\nyear, extended in April 1991 for 5 years to April 1996, and\nextended again in April 1996 for another 5 years to April 2001,\nto coincide with the same time period of the umbrella S&T\nagreement between the USA and the PRC. The Protocol, which\ncontains four annexes (Annex II, III, IV, and V), is intended\nto promote scientific and technical cooperation in\nphotogrammetry, remote sensing !  cartography, geographic\ninformation systems, and map production management, and the\nobservation, development, and processing of geodetic and\ngeophysical data.\n\nMeetings of the Joint Working Group for Scientific and\nTechnical Cooperation in Surveying and Mapping Studies are held\nevery year to introduce the latest developments, review the\npast year's cooperative activities, and develop the work plans\nfor each Annex for the coming year. It was announced at the\nAugust 1998 meeting that the NBSM has changed its name to the\nState Bureau of Surveying and Mapping (SBSM).\n\nRecent achievements under the above annexes include the release\nof small-scale topographic maps and data that were previously\nnot releasable. Environmental information over China at\n1:4,000,000 scale and 1:1,000,000 scale is now available\nbecause of these efforts. Earth gravity data, which was\npreviously unavailable, is now being exchanged. China now\nparticipates on several international standards committees for\ncartographic data and is a significant consumer of\nU.S. computers and software used for GIS. In addition, the SBSM\nhas recently signed a cooperative agreement with the Census\nBureau for the PRC, and is planning to give mapping support to\ntheir work modeled on the USGS/Census cooperation in the\nU.S. SBSM is working on ways to use their GIS expertise and\ndata to meet the needs of construction and water control\nprojects to aid in disaster management such as floods.\n\nThe Protocol is important to USA and PRC exchange activities\nbecause of the basic relationship of surveying and mapping\ninformation to many other Protocols in existence between the\ntwo countries. Moreover, remote sensing and geographic\ninformation systems are developing technologies that are\nimportant to future USGS programs which can benefit from broad\napplications and cooperative exchange of information.\n\nFor more information, link to\n'http://mapping.usgs.gov/html/international/asia.html'\n\n[Summary provided by USGS]",

In 1994, in response to the science proposal to complete the CASERTZ corridors, the National Science Foundation&#039;s Office of Polar Programs requested that the aircraft and its integrated instrumentation package be operated as a facility with a mission of providing aerogeophysical observations to the broader Antarctic science community. This request led to a Cooperative Agreement between UTIG and NSF that created the Support Office for Aerogeophysical Research (SOAR).\nThe SOAR Mission\nThe six-year Cooperative Agreement defined UTIG&#039;s responsibilities as:\n\n\n-Assisting in the development of aerogeophysical research projects with NSF/OPP investigators\n\n-Upgrading the CASERTZ instrumentation package to accommodate new science projects and advances in technology;  fielding this instrument package to accomplish SOAR developed projects\n\n-Distribution of the acquired aerogeophysical data as spatially organized transects to the Project Investigators within six months of its return from the field.\n\nAn option was included for SOAR to reduce and analyze the aerogeophysical data that it collected for members of the scientific community without that capacity.\n\nSOAR Accomplishments\nBeginning in 1994, UTIG conducted aerogeophysical surveys in seven consecutive Antarctic field seasons. These SOAR-developed surveys were performed for the 20 investigators and 14 institutions listed in Table 1. The first six of these seasons were managed under the NSF/UTIG Cooperative Agreement with D. Blankenship as PI; the last, 2000/2001, was managed as a multi-investigator grant to UTIG with D. Blankenship, J. Holt, D. Morse and I. Dalziel as co PI&#039;s. To accomplish these surveys, UTIG configured the integrated instrumentation package and installed it in the aircraft on site in Antarctica each season; additionally, base camp operations were established at up to five remote sites each field season. In total, UTIG conducted an additional 225,000 line kilometers of aerogeophysical surveys in 422 flights covering the areas shown in the Figure. The spatially organized database of geophysical transects was delivered to the various investigators within the targeted six-month time frame.\n\nInformation provided by http://www.ig.utexas.edu/research/projects/soar/",

One fundamental characteristic of SOLAS is that the research is interdisciplinary in that it involves biology, geochemistry, physics, and mathematical modelling.  It also involves another layer of interdependence because  each of these disciplines has a marine side and an atmospheric side.  The two sides of each discipline need to work together so that SOLAS research can be meaningful and successful.  This multi-layered dependence will require a paradigm shift in the arenas of academia and funding, which is more likely to separate disciplines than to combine them.\n\nSOLAS has three scientific foci:\n\nFocus 1: Biogeochemical interactions and feedbacks between ocean and atmosphere\n\nThe objective of Focus 1 is to quantify feedback mechanisms involving biogeochemical coupling across the air-sea interface, which can only be achieved by studying the ocean and atmosphere in concert.  These couplings include emissions of trace gases and particles and their reactions of importance in atmospheric chemistry and climate, and deposition of nutrients that control marine biological activity and carbon uptake.\n\nFocus 2: Exchange processes at the air-sea interface and the role of transport and transformation in the atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers\n\nThe objective of Focus 2 is to develop a quantitative understanding of processes responsible for air-sea exchange of mass, momentum and energy to permit accurate calculation of regional and global fluxes.  This requires establishing the dependence of these facial transfer mechanisms on physical, biological and chemical factors within the boundary layers, and the horizontal and vertical transport and transformation processes that regulate these exchanges.\n\nFocus 3: Air-sea flux of carbon dioxide and other long-lived radiatively active gases\n\nThe air-sea carbon dioxide flux is a key inter-reservoir exchange within the global carbon cycle.  The oceans also play an important role in the global budgets of other long-lived radiatively active gases, including nitrous oxide and to some extent methane.  The objective of Focus 3 is to characterise the air-sea flux of these gases and the boundary layer mechanisms that drive them, in order to assess their sensitivity to variations in environmental forcing.\n\nInternational SOLAS website: http://www.solas-int.org/\n\nSOLAS Project Integration website: http://www.bodc.ac.uk/solas_integration/",

Surface boundary conditions play an important role in initiation and maintenance of the North American Monsoon System (NAMS), which controls summer precipitation over much of this region. \n\nUnderstanding these processes is a focus for the North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME) (http://www.joss.ucar.edu/name/) . A working hypothesis of NAME is that among the land surface antecedent boundary conditions that control the onset and intensity of the NAMS is soil moisture. The influence of the land surface is relayed through surface evaporation and associated surface cooling (dependent on soil moisture), terrain, and vegetation cover. Soil moisture and, in particular, surface wetness, can change dramatically after heavy rain events. Increased soil moisture after precipitation promotes evapotranspiration between storm events. This may contribute to enhanced convection and further precipitation.   \n\nhttp://hydrolab.arsusda.gov/smex04/",

            "definition": "From its original formulation in 1990, the International Trans Antarctic\nScientific Expedition (ITASE) has had as its primary aim the collection and\ninterpretation of a continental- wide array of environmental parameters\nassembled through the coordinated efforts of scientists from several nations.\nThe primary planned product of this cooperative endeavor is the description and\nunderstanding of environmental change in Antarctica over the last ~200 years.\nAs a demonstration of the importance of the original scientific objectives\nposed by ITASE, they were adopted as a key science initiative by both the\nInternational Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) and the Scientific Committee\non Antarctic Research (SCAR).\n\nIn May 1996 a workshop sponsored by the National Science Foundation was held to\ndevelop a Science and Implementation Plan for the United States contribution to\nITASE (called 'US ITASE'). Because of the long-standing US research effort in\nWest Antarctica, US ITASE chose to focus its activities in this region. At the\nUS ITASE Workshop, participants developed a multi-disciplinary research plan\nthat integrates meteorology, remote sensing, ice coring and surface glaciology,\nand geophysics through a four-phase approach. In Phase 1 meteorological\nmodeling and remote sensing will be used to plan sampling strategies conducive\nto the major objectives of US ITASE. Phase 2 will involve ground-based sampling\nover four study areas (corridors). Although a broad spatial sampling of West\nAntarctica is proposed during Phase 2, it is expected that the logistic\nrequirements for this sampling will be modest and highly efficient. Phase 3\nallows for the continuation of ground-based sampling at a limited number of key\nsites where monitoring is required. Phase 4 is interpretation and modeling.\n\nIn its entirety, ITASE incorporates a wide range of general scientific\nobjectives. Those which are specific to US ITASE address the following\nquestions:\n\n1. What is the current rate of change in mass balance over West Antarctica?\n\n2. What is the influence of major atmospheric circulation systems (e.g., ENSO)\nand oceanic circulation on the moisture flux over West Antarctica?\n\n3. How does climate (eg., temperature, accumulation rate, atmospheric\ncirculation) vary over West Antarctica on seasonal, interannual, decadal and\ncentennial scales, and what are the controls on this variability?\n\n4. What is the frequency, magnitude and effect (local to global) of any extreme\nclimate events recorded in West Antarctica?\n\n5. What is the impact of anthropogenic activity (e.g., ozone depletion,\npollutants) on the climate and atmospheric chemistry of West Antarctica?\n\n6. How much has biogeochemical cycling of S, N and C, as recorded in West\nAntarctica, varied over the last 200+ years?\n\nUS ITASE provides an important spatial perspective for the shared research\ngoals of a variety of research programs funded by the NSF, NASA and NOAA.\nNotably, questions 1-4 parallel closely themes identified by NSF's WAIS (West\nAntarctic Ice Sheet) intiative. It is expected that these overlaps of\nscientific purposes will make possible an efficient utilization of logistic\nresources in the execution of these linked research programs. \n\nA series of specific US ITASE products is proposed for the tentatively\nscheduled 1997-2007 duration of this research effort. These products will\nprovide direct benefit to national scientific efforts as noted as well as\ninternationally based science programs developed through SCAR and IGBP. In\norder to further this goal, this report was presented to the international\nrepresentatives attending the jointly sponsored GLOCHANT (SCAR) and PAGES\n(IGBP) ITASE Workshop in Cambridge, England in August 1996. It is expected that\nby the integration of US ITASE with the ITASE activities of other countries,\nmajor contributions will be made to our understanding of Antarctica's role in\nglobal change.\n\nInternet resources:\n\n'http://www.ume.maine.edu/USITASE/'\n'http://nsidc.org/agdc/itase.html'",

The polar-orbiting spacecraft consisted of three major structures: (1) a hollow torus-shaped sensor mount, (2) solar paddles, and (3) a control housing unit that was connected to the sensor mount by a tripod truss structure. Configured somewhat like an ocean buoy, Nimbus 7 was nearly 3.04 m tall, 1.52 m in diameter at the base, and about 3.96 m wide with solar paddles extended. The sensor mount that formed the satellite base housed the electronics equipment and battery modules. The lower surface of the torus provided mounting space for sensors and antennas. A box-beam structure mounted within the center of the torus provided support for the larger sensor experiments. Mounted on the control housing unit, which was located on top of the spacecraft, were sun sensors, horizon scanners, and a command antenna. The spacecraft spin axis was pointed at the earth. An advanced attitude-control system permitted the spacecraft's orientation to be controlled to within plus or minus 1 deg in all three axes (pitch, roll, and yaw). Eight experiments were selected: (1) limb infrared monitoring of the stratosphere (LIMS), (2) stratospheric and mesopheric sounder (SAMS), (3) coastal-zone color scanner (CZCS), (4) stratospheric aerosol measurement II (SAM II), (5) earth radiation budget (ERB), (6) scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR), (7) solar backscatter UV and total ozone mapping spectrometer (SBUV/TOMS), and (8) temperature-humidity infrared radiometer (THIR). These sensors were capable of observing several parameters at and below the mesospheric levels.

Arctic fishes are\nrelatively poorly studied and comparisons with the Antarctic fish\nfauna will be of particular interest in the light of the peculiar\nevolutionary history and geological time scales that characterize the\ntwo polar regions (cf. IPY-activities EBA, ID: 137 and ICEFISH, ID:\n93). Warming trends have been reported for Arctic waters in general\nand the fjords of NE Greenland in particular. The sea ice cover has\nbeen significantly reduced in NE Greenland during the past three\ndecades and this makes the area a timely Arctic key site to study\neffects of climate change on the marine biota. Fishes are known to be\nparticularly sensitive to changes in temperature and salinity. Arctic\nfishes are physiologically adapted to subzero temperatures and live\nwithin a narrow thermal zone (~ 2 °C). Therefore, even a slight\nincrease in temperature, and a concomitant reduction in salinity, may\nhave profound effects on the diversity and physiological performance\nof Arctic fishes. As such, the NE Greenland fish fauna is deemed to be\nan excellent bio-indicator of rapid changes in the Arctic marine\nenvironment.\n\n      The scientific framework includes: 1) Examination of the\ndiversity and physiological adaptations of marine fishes at selected\nsites along the NE Greenland coast, i.e. between Danmarkshavn (77°N)\nand Scoresby Sund Fjord (70°N), and from the innermost part of the\nfjords to the continental slope. 2) Sampling of basic hydrographical\nand topographical data at the same sites, incl. the use of permanent\nCTD-loggers and multi-beam sonar. 3) Repetition of investigations at\nkey sites to obtain long-term data on possible inter-annual changes in\nfish diversity and hydrographical regimes. 4) Establishment of a\nmuseum collection of marine fishes encountered during the expeditions.\n\n      The logistical backbone of TUNU-MAFIG consists of four\nexpeditions to NE Greenland headed by the University of Tromsø. Two\nexpeditions were conducted successfully in autumn 2003 (TUNU-I) and\n2005 (TUNU-II) with the ice strengthened R/V Jan Mayen as the\noperational base. The TUNU-III and -IV expeditions are planned to take\nplace in autumn 2007 and 2008. (*TUNU = East Greenland in the modern\nGreenlandic language)",

The proposal to establish an\nend-to-end, multinational SCPP is based on the evolution of\nexisting program efforts to observe, understand, predict, and\nassess the ocean and the atmosphere. The programmatic strength\nof these efforts has been derived from the support of individual\nfederal agencies working together within the context of the\nU.S. Global Change Research Program (GCRP). These interrelated\nefforts provide the foundation which has enabled the research\ncommunity to provide useful predictions of climate variability\non seasonal to interannual time scales and are each a component\nof a comprehensive Program.  The U.S. proposes to initiate a\nmultinational planning process intended to lead to the\nestablishment of the multinational infrastructure needed to\ngenerate and transfer useful climate information and\nforecasts. This Announcement of Opportunity is intended to\nresult in the establishment of NOAA-designated Research Centers\nto pursue the development of ENSO forecast techniques in\nanticipation of the full multinational structure which will\nevolve for SCPP. NOAA intends to ask one or a group of such\nCenters selected through this announcement to assume specific\nresponsibilities for establishing a center to prepare and\ndisseminate regularly an experimental forecast to all interested\ncountries.

            "definition": "Scientific Objectives:\nSince October 1984, the SAGE II instrument has been flying aboard the\nEarth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) collecting data that are being\nprocessed and archived at NASA LaRC to produce four Level 2 data\nproducts: aerosol extinction profiles at 1020, 525, 453, and 385\nnanometers, and ozone, water vapor, and nitrogen dioxide mixing ratio\nprofiles.  These products are nearly global in coverage, with data\nspanning from 80 degrees North to 80 degrees South latitudes.\nThe accuracy of these data was verified by extensive validation\nefforts and the data sets are now archived and available for general\nscientific use. These data may be of use to investigators who are\ninterested in spatial and temporal variations of ozone, aerosols,\nwater vapor, and nitrogen dioxide caused by seasonal and short-term\nmeteorological variations, atmospheric chemistry and microphysics, and\ntransient phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions.  These data may also\nbe of some benefit for those who perform upper tropospheric studies of\naerosols or who perform climatology studies of cirrus clouds. SAM II,\nSAGE I, and SAGE II have provided data sets that are now available for\nuse and provide a span of aerosol data from late 1978 up through the\npresent time.\nProject Description:\nThe SAGE II instrument is a seven-channel Sun photometer using a\nCassegrainian-configured telescope, holographic grating, and seven\nsilicon photodiodes, some with interference filters, to define the\nseven spectral channel bandpasses. Solar radiation is reflected off a\npitch mirror into the telescope with an image of the Sun formed at the\nfocal plane. The instrument's instantaneous field-of-view, defined by\nan aperture in the focal plane, is a 1/2 X 2-1/2 arc-minute slit that\nproduces a vertical resolution at the tangent point on the earth's\nhorizon of about 0.5 kilometers.  Radiation passing through the\naperture is transferred to the spectrometer section of the instrument\ncontaining the holographic grating and seven separate detector\nsystems. The holographic grating disperses the incoming radiation into\nthe various spectral regions centered at the 1020, 940, 600, 525, 453,\n448, and 385 nanometer wavelengths. Slits on the Rowland circle of the\ngrating define the spectral bandpass of the seven spectral\nchannels. The spectrometer system is inside the azimuth gimbal to\nallow the instrument to be pointed at the Sun without image\nrotation. The azimuth gimbal can be rotated over 370 degrees so that\nmeasurements can be made at any azimuth angle.\nThe operation of the instrument during each sunrise and sunset\nmeasurement is totally automatic. Prior to each sunrise or sunset\nencounter, the instrument is rotated in azimuth to its predicted solar\nacquisition position. When the Sun's intensity reaches a level of one\npercent of maximum in the Sun sensor, the instrument adjusts its\nazimuth position to lock onto the radiometric center of the Sun to\nwithin +/-45 arc-seconds and then begins acquisition of the Sun by\nrotating its pitch mirror in a predetermined direction depending on\nwhether it is a sunrise or a sunset. When the Sun is acquired, the\npitch mirror rotates back and forth across the Sun at a rate of about\n15 arc-minutes per second. The radiometric channel data are sampled at\na rate of 64 samples per second per channel, digitized to 12-bit\nresolution, and recorded for later transmission back to Earth.\nThe SAGE II experiment is ongoing.  The Langley DAAC continues to\narchive these data.\nData Used and Produced:\nThe SAGE II science and engineering data, along with spacecraft time,\nposition, and housekeeping data, are stored aboard the spacecraft and\ndownlinked to NASA GSFC through a ground station. GSFC then forwards\nthese data to LaRC for processing and scientific analysis. GSFC also\nsends spacecraft and solar ephemeris data to LaRC. These data are the\ninput to the inversion process which is explained in the next\nsection. At the completion of the data processing, four Level 2 SAGE\nII products are produced: aerosol extinction profiles, ozone\nconcentration profiles, water vapor profiles, and nitrogen dioxide\nprofiles.\nThe SAGE2_AERO_PRF data set contains over ten years of aerosol\nextinction profiles data.

            "definition": "A program using electronic tagging technologies to study migration patterns of large open-ocean animals and the oceanographic factors controlling these patterns.\n\nAlthough humans have pursued pelagic animals for hundreds - indeed thousands - of years, our understanding of their complex lives remains fragmentary. Historically, the tools available to study animals and their ocean environment have provided only a 'snapshot' view of their lives. Recent technological advances, however, are revolutionizing such studies and will soon provide near-real time, narrative 'motion picture' visualizations of these animals' lives.\n\nThe Tagging of Pacific Predators (TOPP) research program is a collaboration among scientists from the U.S., Australia, Canada, Mexico, Japan, France and the UK, that will apply new technologies to understanding the environmental basis for movements and behaviors of large pelagic animals in the North Pacific. With new electronic tags, TOPP scientists will follow the migrations of marine fishes, turtles, birds, pinnipeds, whales and Humboldt squid as they crisscross the Pacific basin. The results will answer basic questions about the animals' biology including where they feed and breed, and what migration corridors they use. By integrating these biological data with available oceanographic information, scientists can also begin to explore how the dynamic ocean environment influences these basic life functions. By tagging a broad array of taxonomically diverse species, the scientists will gain a broader understanding of how the North Pacific ecosystem functions.\n\nIn addition to providing information about the animals themselves, the data from the tags are invaluable to oceanographers. Although modern oceanographic sciences are aided by satellite-based observations, this view from space can only provide information about the oceans' surface. There is a dearth of information about the water column. This lack of data limits scientists' ability to describe ocean dynamics, and has hampered efforts to understand the coupling between the ocean, atmosphere and climate Understanding of this coupling is a critical component of models that predict changes in the global climate Since many of the TOPP organisms make repeated dives as they travel, they are continually sampling the water column-effectively 'profiling' the ocean along their path.\n\nThe goals of the TOPP program, to obtain both biological and oceanographic information for an array of species, require the development of new tools. Additional tags are being designed that will expand the range of oceanographic parameters that can be measured. Also, the tracking the movements of thousands of individuals require new software for the assimilation, storage, analysis and visualization of 3-D organismal and oceanographic data as it varies through time. The TOPP team is working with experts in computer sciences, oceanographic modeling, and data visualization to develop these tools.\n\nThe TOPP program will provide a more complete understanding about how large open-ocean animals utilize the North Pacific ecosystem as well as about the North Pacific itself. We will know which areas are most critical for feeding, reproduction and migration and better understand the environmental mechanisms that shape these behaviors. This information will both add to our current knowledge about these magnificent creatures, and will be invaluable in establishing ecosystem-based management strategies to ensure the long-term health of populations.\n\nSummary provided by http://www.topp.org/",

            "definition": "Scientific Objectives:\nSurface radiation budget data have the potential for contributing\nsignificantly to improved understanding of the four major components\nof the climate system: the oceans, the land surface, the cryosphere,\nand the atmosphere.  Radiative fluxes into the ocean surface provide\nan important boundary forcing for the ocean general circulation.\nFurthermore, since the radiative fluxes into the ocean surface are\nsignificantly modulated by boundary layer parameters (e.g., clouds,\natmospheric humidity, and temperature), SRB may be an important factor\nin air-sea interactions.  With respect to the land surface, the net\nradiative balance governs the turbulent fluxes of latent and sensible\nheat from the surface into the atmosphere.  Surface radiative fluxes\nare also needed for studies related to the energy and water balance of\nplant canopies.  For the cryosphere, the pack ice and its interaction\nwith surface temperature and solar radiation provides the so-called\nice-albedo feedback which is a vital component governing climate\ntrends on decadal to longer time scales.  Finally, the knowledge of\nSRB together with top-of-atmosphere Earth radiation budget data can\nyield, for the first time, observational estimates of tropospheric\nradiative heating and cloud radiative forcing.\nProject Description:\nThe Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) data sets are derived from a\nvariety of data sources.  The primary data source is the International\nSatellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) C1 data product.  Using\nthe ISCCP C1 parameters as input, SRB results are generated using two\ndifferent algorithms.  The Pinker algorithm (developed jointly by\nDrs. R.T. Pinker and I. Laszlo form the University of Maryland) is a\nphysical model which uses an iterative procedure based on\ndelta-Eddington radiative transfer calculations.  The Staylor\nalgorithm (developed by Mr. W.F. Staylor from the NASA Langley\nResearch Center) is a parameterized physical model in which both cloud\nand aerosol transmission characteristics have been separately tuned to\nhistorical data at various locations around the globe.  Earth\nRadiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) data are also used as input to the\nmodels, as well as for top-of-atmosphere (TOA) irradiance comparisons\nwith the Pinker Model output.  The Swiss Federal Institute of\nTechnology, Zurich, provides ground-truth fluxes from the Global\nEnergy Budget Archive (GEBA).  These data are used for validation of\nthe Pinker and Staylor calculated downward shortwave surface\nirradiances.  SRB uses the same equal area grid system as that used by\nISCCP for its C1 product.  The equal-area grid contains 6596 cells\ncovering the globe; where a cell is approximately 280 km x 280 km at\nthe equator.\nData Products\n-------------\nThe SRB data package consists of daily and monthly shortwave\nparameters covering a forty-six month period from March 1985 through\nDecember 1988.  The principle parameters in the data sets are Pinker\nand Staylor calculated irradiances for the surface and\ntop-of-atmosphere.  The total SRB data package for each month consists\nof six files.  The first file is the ASCII header file, named\nREADME.MMMYY.  The second and third files are ASCII showing Fortran\nlistings of the Pinker and Staylor algorithms (PINKER.FOR and\nSTAYLOR.FOR, respectively).  The fourth and fifth files are binary\ndata files in HDF format.  The fourth file is the monthly binary file\nand presents monthly average gridded values for 52 different items in\neach cell (srb_monavgs_yymm).  The fifth file is the daily binary file\nand presents 24-hr daily average values for 10 key items in each cell\n(srb_dayavgs_yymm).  The sixth file (b_srb_monavgs_yymm.hdf) is a\ngraphics file which contains 19 global images in HDF format.  The\nintent is to allow the user to quickly browse the most important SRB\nparameters without the requirement to read the entire data set.\nProject Archive Contact:  Langley DAAC User Services Office\n     Mail Stop 157D\n     NASA Langley Research Center\n     Hampton, VA  23681-0001\n     USA\n     Phone: (757) 864-8656\n     FAX:   (757) 864-8807\n     Email: INTERNET > larc@eos.nasa.gov\n     WWW Home Page: 'http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/'\nProject Manager Contact:  Dr. Charles H.

Major campaigns by several nations that will culminate in a series of activities during the IPY have agreed to participate in SALE-UNITED. SALE-UNITED is closely aligned with the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Scientific Research Program Subglacial Antarctic Lake Environments (SALE). SALE-UNITED is a coalition of scientists, modellers and technologists from Belgium, Germany, France, Russia, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nThe interdisciplinary objectives of SALE-UNITED have been agreed during a series of international workshops and meetings of the SCAR SALE Group of Specialists (SALEGOS) over the last 6-7 years. SALE-UNITED will be an intensive period of exploration and study of subglacial lake environments advancing scientific discovery in glaciology, biogeochemistry, paleo-climate, biology, geology, tectonics, and ecology. The portfolio of SALE-UNITED projects will advance our understanding of the evolution of subglacial environments; their physical, chemical, and biological settings; the interconnectivity of subglacial hydrological networks; the coupling of ice sheets, climate and life; the tectonic settings; and the role of biogeochemical cycles in sustaining life in these harsh environments. The SALE-UNITED research and exploration program will span Antarctica in order to investigate subglacial lake environments of differing ages, evolutionary histories, and physical settings. These comparative studies will provide an holistic view of subglacial environments over millions of years and under differing climatic conditions. \n\nSALE-UNITED brings together 5 EoIs and coordinates its activities with an additional 30 or more EoIs including Gamburtsev Mountain exploration, major traverse projects and surveys, studies of climate change across the poles, and characterizations of polar ecosystems. Each of these programs will inform and contribute to the accomplishment of the scientific objectives of SALE-UNITED. SALE-UNITED's overarching objectives can only be realized by a coordinated program of exploration and research in multiple subglacial environments over many years. The wished for outcomes cannot be achieved by a single nation or program. Each component of SALE-UNITED will be an independently managed campaign with specific scientific objectives, logistical requirements, and management structures. Individual programs benefit from sharing resources, experiences, expertise, logistics and technologies. \n\nSALE-UNITED will be lead by an International Science and Technology Steering Committee (ISTSC). The ISTSC will form topical committees as needed to address major scientific and technological challenges. Standing Committees for Technology; Data and Information Management; and Education, Outreach and Communications (EOC) will be formed. SALE-UNITED will adhere to the SCAR Communications Plan, Capacity Building Strategy and Data Management Practices and Policies. Individual SALE-UNITED projects will adhere to their national standards for data management, access, and archive. A SALE Program Office and web site have been established and will serve as a focal point for information dissemination and as a data portal.\n\nSALE-UNITED will adhere to the ICSU/WMO data policies and actively participate in all ICSU/WMO EOC activities. The ISTSC will include the leaders of national SALE programs and be augmented by international experts. The development, implementation and promotion of environmentally benign procedures for subglacial lake environment exploration and research programs will be a key guiding principle of SALE-UNITED exploration and research.",

We propose to use the PHSS to address the following questions:\n' What physiological, psychosocial and clinical changes occur in humans temporarily resident and interacting with the extreme environment of Antarctica? \n' Are these changes comparable to those experienced in temporarily resident non-indigenous Arctic populations exposed to difficult environments? \n' How can we best prevent and treat any adverse effects of these changes? \n' How can this understanding enable us to improve healthcare, health and wellbeing of humans in Polar regions, in space and other extreme environments, and in humankind in general?\n\nActivities during this period will include the utilization and enhancement of efficient smart, innovative eHealth and telemedicine technologies in the collection and support of this snapshot of human health during the IPY in polar regions.\n\nThe programme will provide an opportunity for students and scholars from a consortium of educational facilities, universities and research institutes to participate in the proposed research activities and acquire the experience and skills necessary to become the next generation of polar human biology and medicine researchers.\n\nOnce the comprehensive IPY science and operational plans are cemented in national programs, detailed flexible, modular and opportunistic human biology and medicine research planning will be possible, utilizing the various platforms including isolated polar communities, traverses and polar marine cruises. Subprojects utilizing or contributing to the PHSS based on nationally funded priorities will be coordinated by the research group and will include studies in the following domains of interest to Antarctic and Arctic researchers:\n' Epidemiology\n' Physiology\n' Social and Behavioral Sciences (including anthropology, sociology, psychology, social geography and archival domains)\n' Immunology\n' Photo/Chronobiology\n' Public health\n' Nutrition\n' Occupational health\n' eHealth\n\nMany of these subprojects have research modules currently in the field (e.g., Antarctic Multinational Psychology Research Project, Long Term Medical Survey) which will benefit greatly by increased participation and synergies of cross-analysis of datasets across nations, across disciplines and at both poles. Existing and new research modules utilizing new observational techniques will provide a unique opportunity to obtain a snapshot of polar health (leaving a legacy of data and health surveillance systems into the future\n\nExamples of subprojects under consideration include the following:\n1.

To define the rate of transport of trace gases (such as HSCT\nexhaust emissions) from the stratosphere to the troposphere,\ni.e., to determine the global burden that will result from\ncontinuous aircraft emissions into the stratosphere. This\nobjective requires detailed measurements of tracer\nconcentrations close to the tropopause, where tracer gradients\nare very steep.\n\n2. To improve understanding of dynamical coupling and rates for\ntransport of trace gases between tropical regions (where ozone\nformation is most rapid) and higher latitudes and lower\naltitudes (where most ozone resides). For example, we seek to\ndefine the quantity of exhaust entrained from mid-latitude\nsource regions into the tropical upwelling zone, where it can be\ntransported to critical altitudes (above 25 mbar) in the\ntropics.\n\n3. To improve understanding of the chemistry in the upper\ntroposphere and lower stratosphere. This will include the first\nconcerted measurements of the coupled chemistry of odd hydrogen,\nodd nitrogen, and CO in the near-tropopause\nregion. Understanding the partitioning of NOy in this region is\npoorly constrained and the lack of OH and HO2 measurements has\nhindered progress. These observations will address some of the\nkey issues related to the influence of both a potential HSCT\nfleet as well as the existing subsonic fleet on ozone.\n\n4.

The SLICA-RAAS component will focus on spatiotemporal variability of socio-environmental conditions. SLICA-RAAS will contribute to the objectives of assessing the socio-economic impacts of potential future changes in the transitional zones, incorporating results into an expert information system, which will be utilized for estimating climate change responses, sustainable ecosystem management and landscape planning in support of policy decisions; To exchange methods on climate change monitoring, sustainable land use strategy and science/policy issues, and use them as a tool in forecasting ecosystem changes and options for mitigation.\n\nSLiCA itself is an interdisciplinary and international research project, which was founded in 1998. The two major objectives are (1) to develop a new research design for measurement of living conditions and individual well-being among the Inuit and Saami peoples in the Arctic and the indigenous peoples of Chukotka reflecting the welfare priorities of the indigenous peoples and (2) to carry out a survey of living conditions among these peoples. The project is developed in partnership with the indigenous peoples organisations. SLiCA has accomplished the first objective and finished data collection in Canada, Alaska, and Chukotka. By the end of 2006 data collection will be completed also in Greenland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Kola Peninsula. The data material will consist of approximately 8.000 personal interviews.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006 SLiCA is focusing on achieving two main objectives of the project concluding analyses and publishing the findings of the analyses. An additional main objective of the project is to make the international data set available to the scientific and indigenous communities of the Arctic as well as to political and administrative decision makers at the local, regional, national and international levels. The original project scope called for the development of a micro data set that could be shared with these communities. Our analyses to date have revealed a major challenge associated with this approach. The protection of the confidentiality of respondents requires collapsing of response categories for such variables as location (e.g. place), occupation, and income. While we anticipated the need for collapsing response categories, we did not anticipate the degree to which this would pose a constraint for multivariate analyses. We further realize that the challenge of providing analytically robust social science data sets and protecting the confidentiality of respondents is common in the Arctic social sciences. We therefore propose to contribute to the IPY goal of expanding our understanding of human dimensions of change in the Arctic by collaborating with an international team to apply and extend the concepts of remote access analysis to the SLiCA international database.\n\nThe objective of Remote Access Analysis is to provide researchers with access to a micro data set for analysis (i.e. the individual records of respondents to the SLiCA questionnaire) from their own computers. This capability is particularly valuable in the Arctic given the dispersed character of the scientific and indigenous communities and local political and administrative authorities. We further propose to extend this capability to work with restricted datasets where the sensitivity of data is sufficiently high to warrant restriction of access to the raw data. Researchers and indigenous organizations as well as political and administrative authorities at different levels will be able to conduct analyses while making it impossible to view the micro data set itself. To accomplish these objectives, the SLiCA international team is collaborating with the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan and the Computer-assisted Survey Methods Program (CSM) at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nConsistent with the IPY goal of fostering a major step forward in our understanding of the human dimensions of change in the Arctic, we propose to have the SLiCA Remote Access Analysis System in place for the 2008 International Congress of Arctic Social Sciences, ICASS VI (endorsed by the ICSU/WMO Joint Committee for the International Polar Year 2007-2008 as an IPY activity), of the International Arctic Social Sciences Association, IASSA. We will provide a demonstration of the System and a training seminar in the use of the system at the conference.",

An extensive site testing program at the Concordia French-Italian station is underway. Comprehensive results of this program will be available during the year 2007. Small-scale astronomical experiments should also give their first results during the IPY. In 2007, astronomers will then be able to target precisely the best scientific and observational niches for astronomy at Dome C. A European network (coordinated action in the frame of the Large Research Infrastructure Research Programme's of EEC), named ARENA has just started in January, 2006, and is devoted to this task. Among the observational niches, some are already clearly identified : submillimeter wavelengths, high angular resolution, as well as Wide field IR and optical observations, and continuous observations over days or weeks. The IPY offers a unique opportunity to discuss with national and international agencies the frame for a large astronomical infrastructure in Antarctica and to undertake its development.\n\nThe development of astronomy at Dome C, for which several French and international teams (Italy, Australia, China, Germany, United Kingdom) have expressed their interest, has to be carried out in several steps. The next two years (2006-2007) will be devoted to the completion of the site characterization in Summer and Winter. The development of small astronomical experiments will additionally provide a good overview of the specific operational constraints that any observatory will face on this site. \n\nIn the meantime, the polar institutes and astronomical agencies involved in the Concordia station (INAF and PNRA in Italy, IPEV and INSU in France) will discuss, in collaboration with the Arena consortium, whether and how they wish to open officially Concordia to more international collaborations with the long-term goal of an international ambitious observatory on the site. The frame for international collaborations should ideally be determined before end 2006.\n\nOn the scientific side, in 2006 and 2007 several workshops and symposia at the national and international levels will be organized with the aims to survey the scientific topics that can be addressed by polar astronomy. \n\nOur goals during the IPY are then:\n-to define the strategy for a development of astronomy at Dome C, \n-to propose it to the agencies and to have it endorsed, \n-and to increase and develop the funding process. \nThis strategy should be based on the scientific questions that will benefit most from this exceptional site. It should aim at ambitious experiments: if indeed for some questions Dome C is the best site on Earth, we should build there the best possible telescope with the best instrumentation. \nThe legacy of STELLA ANTARCTICA will then be a development plan for an international astronomical observatory at Dome C. This plan will have been endorsed by a consortium of national and international agencies, and its funding secured, possibly through actions of the European FP7, and possibly bilateral agreements with countries outside the EU. \nWhat can be foreseen is a development plan in two major steps:\n- A first step at the European scale, taking advantage of the existing Concordia station and the capabilities of the present Italo-French logistics. Such a European scale astronomical project could be considered in a range of 10-20 M during the next 5 to 10 years.\n- The second step could be much more ambitious and target a world wide astronomical project in the range of 500-1000 M. That will also imply a change of scale of the complete logistics, and must be considered at an horizon of the order of 20 years. Concordia would have then become one of the major world astronomical facilities, and be in the position of playing a key role, like among others, answering one of the fundamental mankind questions: where else in the Universe can Life have developed.",

In the context of our research and applications, urban remote sensing focuses primarily on understanding the physical properties and processes of urban environments and on the mapping and monitoring of urban land cover and spatial extent. These two objectives are related in the sense that it is necessary to understand the physical properties of the urban mosaic in order to rigorously define, map and monitor urban areas.\n\nThe research presented at SEDAC is primarily focused on the physical properties of a wide range of urban environments using passive measurement of optical reflectance and thermal emission as well as optical emission of nighttime lights. Comparative analyses of urban reflectance (visible and infrared color) and surface temperature allow us to develop robust criteria for distinguishing urban land cover from non-anthropogenic land covers. These analyses also provide important constraints on the physical properties that control mass and energy fluxes through the urban environment. These constraints are used as inputs to physical models of climatic, hydrologic and ecologic processes.\n\nhttp://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/ulandsat/",

We propose an IPY cluster to quantify solar variability linkages to weather, climate and ozone.\n\nThe geoelectric circuit links weather and solar activity. It remains an open and a scientifically achievable goal to determine whether or not this linkage is passive or involves active coupling i.e., whether the global circuit merely responds to both meteorological and solar variations, or whether there is an active input to weather and climate via electrically induced changes in cloud microphysics. Present research indicates that the best place to measure the global circuit is the Antarctic plateau (high, dry, relatively meteorologically stable). The Greenland plateau provides an ideal northern hemisphere site. We propose making simultaneous vertical electric field and air-earth current measurements at a range of polar sites (plans presently envisage measurements at Vostok, South Pole and Concordia, 78S 24W, 84S 26W and 75S 70W). We encourage and seek to promote development of further sites, particularly in the northern polar regions. \n\nA model of the global circuit is being developed that incorporates spatially and temporally varying global ion production due to the solar wind modulation of galactic cosmic rays, globally varying tropospheric and stratospheric aerosol concentrations and ion production in the stratosphere from relativistic electron precipitation and solar energetic particle events. It is also planned to insert the polar-cap potential distribution driven by solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling into this model. We propose to compare the model and measurements to quantify limits on the hypothesis that the geoelectric circuit provides a viable path for a sun-weather linkage. Measurements indicate that the geoelectric circuit is sustained by both thunderstorm activity and electrified clouds. Published evidence exists that global thunderstorm activity has a multiplicative dependency on equatorial surface temperatures. Simultaneous measurements of the DC circuit and of power in the Schumann resonance bands may provide sensitive independent proxy monitors for both an equatorially-weighted, global temperature and rainfall. Our team includes a scientist making mid-latitude ELF/VLF measurements recording global lightning activity. We encourage measurements of Schumann resonance power and VLF-lightning data. We propose to determine how accurately our measurements can be used as proxy monitors, and to provide an accurate reference measurement of the geoelectric circuit in the IPY era.\n\nGround-based geoelectric instrumentation on the Antarctic Plateau has recently been used to confirm that broad-scale polar ionospheric convection potentials can be measured independent of the existence of small scale ionospheric irregularities. Our multiple polar-plateau geoelectric field measurements will contribute to understanding and monitoring polar-cap ionospheric convection. \n\nThe circumpolar vortex surrounding Antarctica is typical of the southern polar regions under winter conditions. This strong circumpolar vortex blocks lower latitude, ozone-rich air from reaching central Antarctica. In combination with the lack of solar insolation in winter, the total ozone content above the southern polar regions decreases dramatically. The depth of the so-called ozone hole and its rate of filling in spring depends on the previous state of the atmosphere and has been shown to be affected by external influences related to solar activity. The relative effects of the influences of short-term changes in cosmic ray intensity, variations of the interplanetary electric field on atmospheric parameters (temperature and pressure) in the southern winter polar regions, the dynamics of the ozone layer, the effects of solar UV radiation and the role of the global electric circuit on winter-spring Antarctic ozone concentrations will be examined. A study of pulsed cosmophysical signals in the Arctic (Barentzburg) and in Antarctica (Novolazarevskaya) is proposed. Measurments at Novolazarevskaya have revealed the regular occurrence of pulsed signals in the solar spectrum. The most pronounced pulses have been detected 4 days ahead of solar flare proton events (SPE). Results of the analysis of the spatial-temporal anisotropy of the cosmological signals will be used for derivation of an empirical model and to study the solar sources and mechanism of the pulsed irradiation. Study of the effects of the pulsed radiation on biological and technogenic systems is also planned.Most of our team are actively involved in enthusing students and educating the public. The geoelectric circuit with its link to thunderstorms, sprites, climate change and a sun-weather hypothesis provides considerable scope for such activities. Polar convection studies additionally provide a neat link of this proposed IPY activity with the geophysical focus of the IGY.",

Healthy sagebrush steppe communities in the Great Basin are rapidly disappearing due to invasion of non-native plants (especially cheatgrass), catastrophic wildfires, and encroachment of pinyon-juniper woodlands. Sagebrush communities have been identified as one of the most threatened land types in North America, and as much as half of this land type has already been lost in the Great Basin.

Land management options, including prescribed fire, mechanical thinning of shrubs and trees, and herbicide application will help land managers learn how to reduce the potential for wildfire and restore healthy and diverse native plant communities. The project is fully interdisciplinary, with ecological, economic, and social components. Results of this project will provide resource managers with improved information to make restoration management decisions with reduced risk and uncertainty. \n\n\nhttp://www.sagestep.org/",

During the last two decades, and in the past several years in particular, both polar scientists and local indigenous residents have detected dramatic shifts in the extent, timing, and other key parameters of Arctic sea ice. Whereas earlier IPY ventures contributed greatly to the progress in the scientific knowledge and understanding of polar sea ice, IPY 2007-2008 will become a milestone in the documentation of indigenous knowledge of sea ice environment. It will also set new standards for efforts and methods to bridge scientific and local observations of change in the ice-dominated northern ecosystems.\n\nTo achieve this we propose a coordinated international study of local knowledge and use of sea ice in several indigenous communities across the Arctic region. The acronym for our project's title, Sea Ice Knowledge and Use is also the most general word for sea ice in all Inuit (Eskimo) languages from Bering Strait to Greenland. For many Arctic indigenous peoples, despite rapid and pronounced changes in lifestyles and local cultures the ice-covered sea continues to be an integral component of daily life. It remains the most productive and widely used habitat for six to nine months every year. It is also the main platform for traveling; for observing weather systems, tidal and current cycles, marine mammals and other biota; as well as for training and education in navigational and subsistence skills passed from elders to younger hunters. Further, the status of local use and knowledge of sea ice is also an indicator of social change, a function of new technologies, economic and dietary trends, and of shifts in educational practices and cultural values. For many polar communities the use and knowledge of the ice-covered sea remains the key pillar of identity and resilience. It is their most prized intellectual treasure, the best of their scholarship based upon generations of experience and achievements. For scientists it offers an invaluable vision on how changes in polar ecosystems can be thoroughly documented and internalized through another form of knowledge and observations.\n\nOur effort will include seasonal (long-term) monitoring and extensive documentation of the current status of local sea ice expertise and daily use; knowledge of ice features, hunting and traveling methods; safety rules; patterns of knowledge transmission and hunters' training in several (15 to 20) northern communities. Special focus will be placed upon the documentation of indigenous interpretations of current sea ice characteristics and environmental variability, cultural and ecological responses to increase resilience and community sustainability in times of change. Data will be collected via participant observations, interviews, and recording by local experts to illustrate: i) a seasonal sea ice topology; ii) the extent and areas of use by local people; iii) sea ice hazards; iv) key harvesting areas; v) traditional and current ice routes; vi) place names associated with ice features; vii) shifts in patterns of ice use due to social and/or environmental change; viii) recent and historical changes in subsistence and other societal strategies, due to environmental and socio-economic dynamics.\nThis body of data, supplied by maps, video, photographs, diaries of local observers, dictionaries of sea ice terms and place-names in local languages, along with other forms of records, such as narratives, memoirs, and oral histories, will create the first-ever broad dataset on indigenous knowledge and use of Arctic sea ice as of 2007-2008. Based upon cumulative observations by scientists and indigenous experts, this dataset will offer insight into both the past as well as the current conditions. The 2007-2008 dataset will thus be an invaluable baseline to any prospective comparison to detect future evidence of change, both environmental and social, for years to come and up to IPY-5 in 2057-2058. Another crucial task is to track sea ice changes over the last fifty years, and possibly longer, so that the scope and direction of change can be analyzed over a broader period of time. To achieve this the SIKU project teams will incorporate several senior researchers (science elders') and/or their field data of some 35-50 years ago, including those who had conducted their research in the years of IGY in 1957-1958, and after. This is aimed at matching past observations with the data of today's scholars working in the same communities. In a similar way, indigenous elders and experts are to work closely with hunters and community researchers of younger generations. Historical photographs, researchers' field notes, archival documents, and oral histories will be used extensively, to test the scope of change in ice, knowledge, and subsistence against observations of indigenous and scholarly experts from several generations.\n\nThe study will be undertaken as a network of regional projects led by teams from seven nations and focused on selected sites (communities) or areas (see 2.3). Each team will be multi-generational and will include a senior researcher ('elder') and younger scholars or students as well as local collaborators from various age groups. The project will be organized as a multidisciplinary study, in order to test ice records against the data on terrestrial and marine environments, hunting statistics, and weather patterns. Project personnel will include geographers, anthropologists, ice scholars, marine and terrestrial biologists, hunters, village elders, and subsistence specialists from local agencies.\nThe project will be conducted in partnership with indigenous institutions and communities. Participation and data sharing agreements will be sought with local village councils and hunters' associations as well as regional umbrella organizations (like Inuit Circumpolar Conference-Greenland, Alaskan Eskimo Walrus Commission, and others). Data will be collected, processed, and copied for prospective storage at regional archives, data-centers, and educational institutions. Photographs and records will be shared with local communities and families. The project's scientific products will be presented in team reports, co-authored papers, datasets deposited to the IPY data-management centers (see 3.6), individual/team monographs, and a final project volume of several chapters, organized by major geographic regions.",

            "definition": "[from 'http://www.ig.utexas.edu/research/projects/scarp/scarp.htm']\n\nAntarctica is the Earth's most isolated continent. It is surrounded by\nactively spreading ridges except in the South American sector. The\nmotion of South America with respect to Antarctica is latitudinal and\nleft-lateral at approximately 22 mm per year and is distributed along\nthe boundaries of the intervening Scotia plate. A prominent but\ndiscontinuous bathymetric high known as the Scotia Ridge surrounds the\nScotia plate on three sides. This feature includes some continental\nmaterial detached from the South American and Antarctic continents,\nbut its eastern closure is a volcanically and seismically active group\nof islands, the South Sandwich arc, that is separated from the Scotia\nplate by a vigorously spreading back-arc ridge. The entire\neast-closing, locally emergent bathymetric feature joining the two\ncontinents, is known as the Scotia arc. The D-shaped Sandwich plate\nand arc appear to be moving rapidly east with respect to both South\nAmerica and Antarctica, thereby for the first time introducing a\nsubduction system into the otherwise rift-bounded South Atlantic Ocean\nbasin. This motion may constitute the best evidence for mantle return\nflow from the closing Pacific Ocean basin to the expanding Atlantic\nOcean basin. The Scotia arc is nonetheless one of the most poorly\nconstrained of the major tectonic systems on Earth, yet it is a\ncritical and enigmatic link in global plate-motion circuits.\n\n\nOur proposed ScArc GPS Project (SCARP) will use the Global Positioning\nSystem (GPS) to measure the plate motions between South America,\nAntarctica and Africa, and around the Scotia arc using a newly\ndeveloped geodetic strategy known as a multimodal occupation strategy\n(MOST). This involves setting up permanent GPS receivers at a small\nnumber of sites in South America and Antarctica, and using additional\nreceivers to position numerous stations relative to this continuously\noperating network. Two seasonally occupied stations in the South\nSandwich islands will be tied to permanent GPS sites in South America,\nAntarctica and Africa, and to intervening stations in the Falkland,\nSouth Georgia and South Orkney islands that will be occupied on an\noccasional basis by British collaborators. During the initial three\nyears the South Sandwich arc motion will be easily resolved, and using\nroving stations in the Antarctic Peninsula-South Shetland Islands\narea, we should be able to determine if extension is occurring across\nBransfield Strait. We also propose to construct a relatively dense\nsubnetwork in Patagonia/Tierra del Fuego, and a moderately dense\nsubnetwork in the Antarctic Peninsula. While we do not expect to\nachieve sub-millimeter/year velocity resolution in the initial three\nyear project with these subnetworks, this project will establish the\nbaseline necessary for a follow-on suite of measurements in perhaps\nsix to eight years. The follow-on project will allow us to\ncharacterize the slow motions and deformations that occur across and\nwithin the boundaries of the Scotia plate. The deformation at the\nSouth Sandwich Trench and seafloor spreading behind the arc will be\ninvestigated by marine geophysics while GPS measurements are be\nundertaken on the islands.\n\n\nThe objectives of SCARP are to determine:\n\n1. the relative motions of the Antarctic, South American, Scotia and\nSouth Sandwich plates;\n\n2. the rate of rollback of the South Sandwich Trench in a South\nAmerican-African framework;\n\n3. strain partitioning within the South America-Scotia plate boundary\nzone, Tierra del Fuego;\n\n4. the rate of extension across the volcanically active Bransfield\ntrough and the present rate of uplift or subsidence of the extinct\nSouth Shetland Islands volcanic arc.\n\nThese objectives in turn will allow us to:\n\n1. Evaluate what the South Sandwich trench rollback tells us about\nmantle flow and the potential for transforming a passive rifted ocean\nbasin into a subducting or disappearing ocean basin. This also\nrequires shipboard work that will allow us to investigate deformation\nof the South American plate as it is subducted at the South Sandwich\ntrench;\n\n2. Test for motion between East and West Antarctica postulated as a\nsource of error in global plate circuits\n\n3. Determine why there is transpression along the northern boundary of\nthe Scotia plate and transtension along its southern boundary; and\n\n4. Contribute to a geodetic assessment of the elastic displacement\nfield associated with extension in Bransfield Strait and the\naccumulation or loss of ice on the Antarctic continent.",

            "definition": "The WMO/WWRP’s THORPEX Global Research Programme involves nations from North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Southern Hemisphere. THORPEX intends to conduct research that will accelerate improvements in the prediction and understanding of high-impact weather on the 1 to 14-day time-scale for the benefit of society, the environment and the economy.\nThe aims of this cluster proposal are to improve numerical weather prediction model systems and climate models by utilizing remotely sensed and in situ observations taken during the IPY and to study and advance our knowledge of meteorological, surface and ocean phenomena typical for the region. The investigations will also improve our understanding and modelling of polar-global interactions. The scope ranges from high-resolution numerical weather prediction to climate and regional ocean modelling. The motivation comes from several applications: 1) Regional weather forecasting: In polar areas there are strong needs for accurate weather forecasts. Further model-based ocean, ice and wave forecasting need accurate forcing fields. 2) Medium range (global) weather forecasting: Improved model quality in polar areas influences forecasts at mid and high latitudes. 3) Climate studies.\nThe project has four objectives:\nThe first is on forecasting and to what degree an improved use of satellite data and an optimized observational network, including targeted observations, will improve forecasts of high impact weather events (IPY project numbers 294; 394; 638; 600; 798; 811; 113; 146; 206, 410, 92, 888, contribution related to meteorology). These studies will not be limited to forecasting conditions over the poles, but will also address polar-global interactions. These investigations will provide insight into the design of the global observing system and into the potential impact of any IPY legacy measurement sites. New satellite technologies will be used to develop products that can potentially improve weather forecasts.\nThe second objective is to better understand physical and dynamic processes in the polar regions, in general, with a specific emphasis on aerosols, the microphysical properties of clouds and the possibility of improving parameterisation schemes of clouds and radiation for use in numerical weather prediction and climate models (294; 638; 600; 798; 70; 116; 158; 206; 410; 113, 297). The spatial variations in surface characteristics, stable lapse rates and extreme seasonal variations in solar radiation make the polar environment unique and a challenge for parameterizations.\nThe third objective is a deeper understanding of the polar regions through a focus on small scale weather phenomena and the impacts of topography and surface variations (394; 638; 618; 811; 113; 134; 146; 167; 297; 888, contribution related to meteorology). Such research will also provide valuable insight on the limitations of coarse-grid models, since recent research has provided evidence for a wide variety of circulations (terrain-induced vortices, downslope winds, flow channelling, thermodynamic impacts of open water etc) that are often sub-grid-scale in climate and many forecast models. This work includes investigations of the flow distortion over Greenland and how it impacts the mesoscale thermohaline circulation. In some cases the higher resolution modelling capability will remain in place as a legacy of THORPEX-IPY activities.\nTaken together the research results from first three objectives the potential to improve future predictions of the weather and climate over the polar regions. Improvement in the initial state means an improved time series of operational and research analyses for climate change research.\nThe final objective is to utilize improved forecast systems to benefit society, economy and environment. High-impact weather events in polar regions include spring thaws, sea ice movement, and severe winter cyclones resulting in strong winds, high seas, and heavy precipitation as defined by their impact on public safety, fisheries and fishery management, activities of the indigenous arctic populations, wildlife, energy production and transportation. These problems are not local to the poles as the intrusion of polar air masses into higher latitudes also has dramatic impacts and many of the polar events are linked to wave trains that are initiated at lower latitudes. During IPY, the major operational forecast centers of the world will co-operate to form a THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) that will form the basis for research on ensemble prediction and on improving society’s ability to utilize forecast information. TIGGE will also be made available for IPY field operations.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=121",

In expanding its scope to meet interdisciplinary interests, the main considerations in the experimental design have been (1) maintaining as much spatial airborne coverage as possible on a daily basis; (2) nesting when- and where-ever possible to allow observations at a hierarchy of scales; and (3) making maximum use of existing facilities in the area.\n\nThe core of this project is the large scale aircraft soil moisture mapping. Within logistic and fiscal constraints, this experiment will attempt to map surface soil moisture over an area of ~10,000 km2 (order of magnitude larger than previously observed) at a spatial resolution compatible with known data interpretation algorithms (~1 km). The resulting data base would allow the scaling up to projected satellite sized footprints (~10 km) and cover an area large enough to provide over 100 pixels of this size. These data would allow the examination of the information content of coarse resolution data as well as the analysis of the spatial/temporal scales generally utilized in hydrological and hydrometerological models. We will attempt temporal coverage on a daily basis over a period of one month.\n\nData will be collected using an L band passive microwave mapping instrument called ESTAR which will be flown on a P-3 aircraft. In addition to the L band system, a single beam thermal infrared sensor and a dual polarization C band microwave radiometer will be flown.\n\nThe temporal analysis will be enhanced by making continuous 24-hour observations using a truck based microwave radiometer system to complement the once-a-day aircraft measurements. This system consists of L, S, and C band single polarization instruments as well as thermal infrared. It would be located at the DOE ARM CART Central Facility which will provide the most comprehensive temporal observations.\n\nThe boundary layer component of SGP97 is configured to primarily evaluate the influence of soil moisture on the local surface energy budget and the influence of mesoscale variability in the surface energy budget on the development of convective boundary layer. To the extent possible, attempts will be made to quantify the water vapor budget of the boundary layer (advection, entrainment, and evapotranspiration) using remotely sensed and in situ data. \n\nInformation provided by http://hydrolab.arsusda.gov/sgp97/explan/section1.html",

Annual and interannual variability will be\nstudied directly through long-term observations and detailed process studies;\nvariability at longer time scales will be examined through retrospective\nanalysis of directly measured and proxy data. Coupled biophysical models of the\necosystems of these regions will be developed and tested using the process\nstudies and data collected from the long-term observation programs, then\nfurther tested and improved by hindcasting selected retrospective data series.\n\nU.S. GLOBEC Northeast Pacific (NEP) Homepage:\nhttp://globec.oce.orst.edu/groups/nep/\n\nData is available on-line through the U.S. GLOBEC Data System at\nhttp://globec.whoi.edu/jg/dir/globec/nep/\n\n[This information was adapted from the U.S. GLOBEC web pages.]",

            "definition": "For decades, both private and public enterprises in America disposed of hazardous waste improperly, contaminating the nation’s soils, water, and air, creating tens of thousands of hazardous sites, and threatening human health and the environment. In response to community outcries for action, Congress passed on December 11, 1980 the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly known as Superfund. CERCLA and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 place a tax on the chemical and petroleum industries, generating a trust fund of billions of dollars to clean up abandoned and dangerous sites. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI), part of the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER), manages the Superfund program that addresses both the short and long-term threats from potential releases of hazardous substances. EPA partners with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Superfund Research Program (SRP) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to better understand and address the public environmental health issues related to Superfund sites. All of these agencies encourage communities living near sites impacted by hazardous substance to fully participate in decisions made about site management, and recognize the importance of making the science and related information about these sites accessible to these communities.\n\nThe Superfund Site Footprints collection of data sets is being made available to assist a wide range of researchers, government regulators, and community stakeholders who are concerned with the assessment and remediation of Superfund sites in the United States and its territories. The data provided here can be used to more precisely visualize the location of the sites in proximity to potentially vulnerable populations and ecosystems. Most of the site locations are displayed as polygon shapefiles and the remaining as points. A number of site attributes are linked to these locations. In addition, it is possible to use these data sets with other data layers in a GIS that integrates the Superfund site attributes with nearby demographic characteristics, environmental features, and critical infrastructures.\n\nSo far, these data sets, Version 1 and Version 2 respectively, have been used to undertake an Assessment of Populations in Proximity to Superfund National Priorities List Sites for the year 2000 and to create the NPL Superfund Footprint: Site, Environmental, and Population Characteristics, an online interactive mapping tool. The Assessment was generated in response to a request by the NIEHS to estimate how many people live within four miles of a Superfund site. It uses methodologies and data sets that more accurately than previous analyses determine population totals and demographic breakdowns in proximity to NPL sites. The Mapper is an innovative tool which can enhance the visualization and understanding of the characteristics of vulnerable populations, built and natural features, and environmental exposures near the National Priorities List Superfund sites. Both products were created by the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) as part of the Columbia University Superfund Research Program’s Research Translation Core.  The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) funded the work on the Mapper as a supplemental grant to the Columbia University Superfund Research Program on the Health Effects and Geochemistry of Arsenic and Manganese (NIEHS 3 P42 ES010349-10). The dissemination of the data sets included in this collection is funded by SEDAC.\n\nhttp://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/superfund",

Nine instruments and a group of\ntheoretical investigators were chosen by an open proposal selection\nprocess. An additional instrument, ACRIM, was given a flight of\nopportunity on the UARS spacecraft. Due to funding delays and the\nChallenger accident, UARS was not launched until 1991. UARS is\nconsidered the first of the Mission to Planet Earth (now Earth Science\nEnterprise) series of NASA spacecraft.\n\nUARS was launched on September 15, 1991 by the Space Shuttle\nDiscovery. It is 35 feet long, 15 feet in diameter, weighs 13,000\npounds, and carries 10 instruments. UARS orbits at an altitude of 375\nmiles with an orbital inclination of 57 degrees. Designed to operate\nfor three years, eight of its ten instruments are still\nfunctioning.

The Survey is a major contributor to the Census of Antarctic Marine Life and SCAR's Marine Biodiversity Information Network SCAR-MarBIN. \n\nThe overall purposes of the Survey are to map the spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity of the plankton through the region, and then to use the sensitivity of plankton to environmental change as early warning indicators of the health of Southern Ocean. The Survey will also serve as a reference on the general status of the Southern Ocean for comparison with other monitoring programs.\n\nUnderstanding patterns of variation in biological systems, both natural and those caused climate change, is an integral pattern of research in Antarctica. Plankton are the foundation of the Antarctic marine ecosystem and are thus the logical place to start such research. The CPR has proved to be the most cost-effective means of rapidly and repeatedly surveying plankton in large ocean systems with minimal or no cost in ship time. The CPR provides contiguous maps of zooplankton over large areas ideal for biogeographic mapping, especially in relation to frontal zones, and providing spatial-temporal variation in zooplankton community structure.\n \nThe SO-CPR Survey is an independent established program, but is part of a larger consortium CPR surveys in the North Sea, North Atlantic and North Pacific, operating through the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS), that is providing an important survey tool on the health of ocean systems as well as supporting specific research such as the Census of Marine Life (CoML) and Census of Antarctic Marine Life (CAML). \n\nhttp://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/cpr/",

Additionally, the buoys deployed were endorsed as an IPY contribution to the WCRP/SCAR International Programme on Antarctic Buoys (IPAB). The major goals of this study were to investigate the evolution of the sea ice cover in the Bellingshausen−Amundsen−Ross Seas during the late winter−summer periods. A ship−based study (NB Palmer) conducted in the Bellingshausen Sea focused on the first half of the period when the net radiation balance was still negative (Sept−Oct). The ship studies, including transit sampling stations and a drifting station were extended to include the remaining evolution of the ice cover into early summer using autonomous mass balance buoys and high temporal motion buoys, and complementary satellite measurements from the ICES at laser altimeter, RadarSAT SAR, and AMSR-E passive microwave instruments.\n\nWork from the NB Palmer was a drifting station tied to an ice floe for 27 days in the Bellingshausen Sea during a 60 day cruise, Sept−Oct 2007. During the cruise and on the ice station, on−ice measurements were conducted on sea ice physical, biological and biogeochemical properties. The ice station work included time series measurements of these properties at two sites over the period of ice station occupation. CTD and trace metal casts were conducted in transit and at the ice station. Drifting ice mass balance buoys measuring snow and ice thickness changes, ice temperatures, CTD, and under ice spectral irradiance were deployed at the ice station site and continued to transmit autonomously for up to six weeks after the ice station work until early Dec 2007. At the ice station site, and also in transit to and from the main floe ice, surveys of snow and ice physical properties were conducted. The surveys consisted of horizontal transects measuring at intervals snow depth, ice thickness and the areal extent and thickness of flooded layers observed at the snow ice interface. Line measurements were repeated three times during the twenty seven day ice station period to determine changes in snow and ice properties and thickness. Swath bathymetry of the ocean bottom during drift station and transit was obtained and ADCP profiles were continuously recorded throughout the drift station and during transit. \n\nTwo other activities were conducted under the auspices of the SIMBA project.\n\nOden Cruise 2006-summer ice conditions. This first cruise of the Oden to McMurdo Sound in 2006 consisted of underway ice observations by this project of summer ice conditions across the Ross Sea during the transit. These observations were then used to validate AMSR-E passive microwave estimates of sea ice extent and concentration along the cruise track, other comparisons were made with satellite-based ice mapping of sea ice extent conducted by the National Ice Center during the period of the cruise.\n\nDeployment of Ice Mass Balance buoy- Summer-Fall Transition in the Amundsen Sea One Ice Mass Balance buoy (IMB) that had been deployed during the drift phase of SIMBA in Oct 2007 and recovered at the end of the drift deployment was redeployed during the NB Palmer cruise to the Amundsen Sea in Jan-Feb 09.This buoy provided ice temperature, CTD, and ice and snow thickness information for seven weeks, from late summer-fall, contrasting with the spring-summer transition observed from the buoys deployed on the SIMBA drift station in 2007.",

Along this ice divide, Earth's oldest layered ice, long-isolated subglacial lakes, and important earth crustal structures are located. Antarctic mass balance is the most significant gap in determining the current role of the cryosphere on the present and future contribution of land ice to sea level change. Despite past international efforts, most of the East Antarctic ice sheet is still unexplored and its subglacial geologic setting is completely unknown. East Antarctic ice cores provide the longest records of climate and atmospheric parameters but we still have an imperfect understanding of the means by which the signals of regional and global climate variability reach the coring sites and are locked into the ice records. \nOnly through a concerted international effort will it be possible to access the interior of East Antarctica with sufficient logistic support for on ground cutting edge research in the hitherto almost totally unexplored regions and to link coastal sites with the interior.\nSeveral countries, under the auspices of SCAR and COMNAP have extensive experience undertaking ambitious scientific traverse programs in Antarctica. Twenty SCAR countries have been involved in the SCAR-IGBP ITASE traverse program during the last 10 years. TASTE-IDEA project represents the IPY evolution of this very successful programme. The traverses, coupled with airplane support, operate effectively as a polar research vessel, and offer ground-based platforms for multidisciplinary research coupled with the most modern technology. \nThe International Polar Year Trans-Antarctic Scientific Traverses objectives and main goals are to:\n- Obtain a new set of ice cores to extend the record of climate variability in the past on time-scales from years to millennia to integrate the short duration and lacking in instrumental record.\n- Survey of inner and coastal unexplored part of the continent by means of geophysical measurements, shallow drillings and remote sensing techniques.\n- Obtain a chronological linkage between the main deep ice drill sites in East Antarctica and survey the present-day variability in climate-meteorological condition.\n- Study how the signals of regional and global climate variability reach the coring sites and are locked into the ice record through the load and composition of atmospheric aerosol and gases and the processes occurring at the atmosphere/snow interface\n- Study the effect of the ice divide on the present climatic conditions and determine the past variations of ice divide and dome location.\n- Obtain geophysical and glaciological surveys required to identify the location of the longest coherent climate record in Antarctic ice.\n- Provide new information for surface mass balance and ice sheet elevation change.\n- Survey the ice dynamics and geologic setting of important earth crustal structures of East Antarctica Precambrian craton and at subglacial lake site.\n- Deploy permanent and/or semi-permanent instruments in inaccessible regions for exploring Planet Earth and beyond.\n- Revisit areas and sites first explored during IGY traverses to observe possible changes.\nIn order to achieve optimal results the scientific efforts along the individual traverse legs must be well coordinated, with a clear overall science plan and time frames for e.g. meteorological observations or upper air soundings.",

            "definition": "The Soviet/American Gas and Aerosol (SAGA) Expeditions II and III were\nto measure radiatively important trace species in the marine\nenvironment. NOAA/CMDL participated in both cruises in 1987 and 1990.\nThe overall goal of SAGA II was to evaluate the sources,\ndistributions, and fates of climatically significant trace species in\nthe remote, marine environment. The studies were to focus on obtaining\nlatitudinal distributions of key gaseous and aerosol species from 50 deg N\nto 40 deg S, defining the downwind plume from continental Asia over the\nWest Pacific and East Indian Oceans, and evaluating the air-sea\nexchange of biogenic and anthropogenic trace gases. NOAH and the\nCarbon Cycle Group were responsible for the organization of\nNOAA/CMDL's effort and the measurement of a suite of rediatively\nimportant trace species (RITS) in both the water and the atmosphere.\nFive trace gases in the surface water and atmosphere of the West\nPacific and East Indian Oceans were measured by automated gas\nchromatography from May through July 1987. The data included more than\n1000 measurements each of N2O, F11, and F12 in the surface water and\nin the atmosphere, and about 2000 measurements each of CH4 and CO2 in\nthe surface water and atmospheric boundary layer of the West\nPacific. In addition, over 600 measurements of dissolved N2O were\nobtained from hydrocasts made along the entire 45000 km cruise track.\nThe ship Akademik Korolev, used in the SAGA II expedition, departed\nHilo, HI on 1 May 1987, to proceed towards the Kuril trench, headed\nsouth along 160 deg E and 170 deg E meridians and terminated its first\nleg in Wellington, New Zealand on 9 June 1987. Leg 2 ran south of\nAustralia then north along 90 deg E to Singapore between 12 June and 6\nJuly. Leg 3 began on 9 July in Singapore and was essentially a\ntransect along 5 deg N turning up toward Hilo, HI at 180 deg E where\nit arrived on 28 July 1987.\nThe overall goal of SAGA III was similar to the one of SAGA II. In\naddition, main objectives were to evaluate the spatial and temporal\nvariability of trace gases across the interhemispheric tropical\nconvergence zone (ITCZ), to trace the zonal movement of the ITCZ, to\ndetermine halocarbon saturation anomalies and to assess their use in\ncalculating air-sea transfer coefficients, to measure the flux of N2O\nfrom equatorial waters, and to compare the results to those made in\n1987, an El Nino year.  As for SAGA II, the Akademik Korolev was used\nduring this expedition. The cruise began in February 1990 in Hilo, HI,\nand crossed the equator seven times zig-zagging between 20 deg N and\n15 deg S before ending in Singapore in April 1990.\nReferences:\nTrace Gases in and Over the West Pacific and East Indian Oceans During\nthe El Nino-Southern Oscillation Event of 1987, J.H.

Participating youth will travel on the expeditions together teams of leading scientists, expert and educators. The ice-strengthened ship-based expeditions will be unparalleled platforms for Polar Education. Since 1999, Students on Ice - the world leader in educational youth expeditions to the Polar Regions - has successfully operated 10 youth expeditions to both the Arctic and the Antarctic involving over 500 youth from 25 countries. Students on Ice is a member of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, and has been awarded the prestigious Michael J. Smith Award for Science Promotion in Canada. SOI-IPY will build on this success and experience together with international partners and related IPY initiatives. SOI-IPY will provide inspiring, life-changing experiences to youth; will inspire the next generation of Polar researchers and scientists; will raise awareness internationally about IPY and polar issues; develop Polar curriculum and resources; create media attention and a tv-documentary series; and overall will serve as a tremendous IPY legacy project.\n\nSOI-IPY will organize and operate one Arctic expedition and one Antarctic expedition each year between 2007-2009, for a total of six educational polar expeditions between 2007-2009. The possibility of doing more than two expeditions per year will be determined by demand and funding. With sufficient interest and support, SOI-IPY will operate seperate high-school and university expedition programs.\n\nEach expedition will have 75 participating youth, and 35 scientists, experts, educators, world leaders, journalists, etc. Participating youth will be between the ages of 14-25 yrs. The goal is to have a total of 450 participating youth from countries all around the world. Students will be selected through an application process available on the Students on Ice website www.studentsonice.com. Partnerships and contests around the world will also help to select the participating students. Corporate, government, foundation and private sector funding will assist youth with the costs to participate. In some cases, youth will also raise some or all of the funds required to participate. Through existing partnerships with the Arctic Council's Future of Children and Youth Initiative and other Aboriginal organizations, SOI-IPY will endeavor to have indigenous youth and staff from all of the circumpolar countries on each polar expedition.\n\nStudents will participate in a world-class, multi-disciplinary education program prior to and during each expedition. The academic program will weave together elements of experiential, expeditionary, and problem-based learning, and will focus on Experience, Understanding, Inspiration, Transformation, Action, and Change. Lectures, workshops, and hands-on activities will focus on subjects such as marine biology, glaciology, geology, environmental issues and sciences, history, culture, politics, flora and fauna, oceanography, sustainability, traditional knowledge, art, technology, and much more. Some of the scientific/education team will conduct hands-on science activities and research as part of their ongoing research projects. Youth forums, student-led action groups, and inter-generational mentoring are examples of other learning formats that will be incorporated. \n\nThe educational benefits of SOI-IPY will be shared with millions of youth and the general public around the world via live video-conferencing, the SOI-IPY website, presentations, and conferences. Partnerships with schools and other educational organizations will bring the SOI-IPY directly to classrooms around the world. A team of international journalists and a film crew making a TV documentary series will help to give the youth voice a platform, spread IPY messages, and raise awareness about the environmental, historic, political and scientific importance of the planet's polar regions. \n\nSOI-IPY will partner with a number of respected organizations such as the Royal Canadian Geographic Society, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Explorer's Club, The Royal Geographic Society, the IPY Youth Steering Committee, the Youth Science Foundation, Science North, Canadas Department of Foreign Affairs, the Canadian Museum of Nature, the Canadian Space Agency, the International Baccalaureate Organization, and the International Polar Foundation.",

            "definition": "Hindcasts for the Indian summer monsoons (ISMs) of 2002 and 2003 have been produced from an ensemble of numerical simulations performed with a global model by changing SST. Two sets of ensemble simulations have been produced without vegetation: (i) by prescribing the weekly observed SST from ECMWF (European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting) analyses, and (ii) by adding weekly SST anomalies (SSTA) of April to the climatological SST during the simulation period from May to August. For each ensemble, 10 simulations have been realized with different initial conditions that are prepared from ECMWF data with five each from April and May analyses of both the years. The predicted June-July monsoon rainfall over the Indian region shows good agreement with the GPCP (observed) pentad rainfall distribution when 5 member ensemble is taken from May initial conditions. The All-India June-July simulated rainfall time series matches favourably with the observed time series in both the years for the five member ensemble from May initial condition but drifts away from observation with April initial conditions. This underscores the role of initial conditions in the seasonal forecasting. But the model has failed to capture the strong intra-seasonal oscillation in July 2002. Heating over equatorial Indian Ocean for June 2002 in a particular experiment using 29th May 12 GMT as initial conditions shows some intra-seasonal oscillation in July 2002 rainfall, as in observation. Further evaluation of the seasonal simulations from this model is done by calculating the empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of the GPCP rainfall over India. The first four EOFs explain more than 80% of the total variance of the observed rainfall. The time series of expansion coefficients (principal components), obtained by projecting on the observed EOFs, provide a better framework for inter-comparing model simulations and their evaluation with observed data. The main finding of this study is that the All-India rainfall from various experiments with prescribed SST is better predicted on seasonal scale as compares to prescribed SST anomalies. This is indicative of a possible useful seasonal forecasts from a GCM at least for the case when monsoon is going to be good. The model responses do not differ much for 2002 and 2003 since the evolution of SST during these years was very similar, hence July rainfall seems to be largely modulated by the other feedbacks on the overall circulation.\n\nhttp://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=18282121",

It was hypothesized that this water is transported offshore in spring by a semi-permanent cyclonic eddy located at about 32/degree/N, 79/degree/W. The SPREX field program included a large array of moored current meters and other instruments, and three research vessels (R/V Cape Florida, R/V Cape Hatteras, and R/V Blue Fin) that conducted hydrographic mapping and biological and chemical sampling. Ship surveys (Cape Hatteras and Cape Florida) were designed to provide near synoptic coverage of a few specific events during SPREX. The purpose of the surveys was to determine the time variations in fresh water content and tracer concentrations over the shelf, the characteristics of shelf water/Gulf Stream water interaction, and biological responses to the events. The general cruise plan was for the Cape Florida to occupy CTD stations along cross-isobath transects out to the shelf break at three primary locations/endash/Savannah, Charleston, and Myrtle Beach. 4 refs., 1 fig., 1 tab.\n\nInformation provided by http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=6840203",

By studying natural climate archives in terrestrial and marine sediments from Svalbard, N Norway, NW Russia and adjoining seas we will advance the knowledge on processes operating during non-glacial and glacial periods. We will use this to reconstruct past changes in the climate, and the physical environment during the last interglacial-glacial cycle. This will be used to gain new insights into human immigration and adaptation strategies at the end of the last glaciation. Our cross-institutional and multidisciplinary team will use both new and well-established methods to extract quantitative and qualitative paleoclimate data to explore the interplay between the Arctic land, ocean, ice sheets and early human settlement. We will investigate modern and past land-ocean environments, including: 1) variability in the influx of warm Atlantic Water and its implications for growth and decay of ice sheets and ice streams; 2) fresh water flux to the ocean through outbursts of ice-dammed lakes and re-routing of NW Russian rivers; 3) early human responses to rapid changes in sea-level and temperatures at the end of the last glaciation, and 4) models of the human pioneer adaptations and settlement.\n\nSciencePub will strive to leave a lasting legacy of increased public awareness of the natural environmental system of the Arctic through outreach activities. These will include networking information officers from all partner institutions, training of science journalists, and by developing visualizations and mobile exhibitions.

            "definition": "Scientific Objectives:\nThe Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment I instrument, a Sun\nphotometer, aboard the Applications Explorer Mission-2 (AEM-2)\nsatellite began collecting data in October 1979.  The scientific\nobjective was to develop a global stratospheric aerosol, ozone, and\nnitrogen dioxide database that could be used for the investigation of\nthe spatial and temporal variations of these species caused by\nseasonal and short-term meteorological variations, atmospheric\nchemistry, microphysics, and transient phenomena such as volcanic\neruptions.  The database could also be used for the study of trends,\natmospheric dynamics and transport, and potential climatic effects.\nThe SAGE I sensor was designed to measure the attenuation of solar\nradiation resulting from atmospheric aerosol, ozone, and nitrogen\ndioxide at four spectral regions through the Earth's atmosphere during\neach spacecraft sunrise and sunset.\nProject Description:\nThe AEM-2 satellite was placed in an orbit of approximately 600\nkilometers at an inclination of 56 degrees to extend the latitudinal\ncoverage for the solar occultation measurements from 79 degrees South\nto 79 degrees North.\nThe SAGE I instrument consists of four spectral channels centered at\nwavelengths of 1000, 600, 450, and 385 nanometers for measuring global\ndata concerning aerosol vertical extinction profiles, ozone vertical\nconcentrations profiles, and nitrogen dioxide vertical concentrations\nprofiles during spacecraft sunrise and sunset.  The solar wavelengths\nof 1000 and 450 nanometers are used to generate altitude profiles of\nozone and nitrogen dioxide concentration.  The SAGE I aerosol data\nwere validated by comparison with correlative lidar and dustsonde in\nsitu measurements, the ozone data were validated by comparison with\nballoon ECC ozonesonde and rocket measurements, and the nitrogen\ndioxide measurements were compared with climatology.\nThe operation of the instrument, during each sunrise and sunset\nmeasurement, was totally automatic.  Prior to each sunrise or sunset,\nthe instrument was rotated in azimuth to its predicted solar\nacquisition position.  When the Sun entered the instrument's field of\nview, the instrument adjusted its azimuth position to lock onto the\nradiometric center of the Sun to within +/- 45 arcsec and then\nacquired the sun by rotating its scan mirror to the proper elevation\nangle.  As the Sun traversed between the horizon and the tangent\nheight of 150 kilometers, radiometric channel data were sampled at a\nrate of 64 samples per second per channel, digitized to 12-bit\nresolution, and recorded for later transmission back to Earth.\nAdditional SAGE I instrument information can be found in McCormick et\nal (1979).  The SAGE I instrument collected data for almost three\nyears until the AEM-2 satellite power subsystem failed.\nData Used and Produced:\nThe SAGE I science and engineering data, along with spacecraft time,\nposition, and housekeeping data, were stored aboard the spacecraft and\nthen down linked to NASA GSFC through a ground station.  GSFC then\nforwarded these data to LaRC for processing and scientific analysis.\nGSFC also sent spacecraft and solar ephemeris data to LaRC on separate\nweekly tapes.\nLaRC combines three data sources to produce the SAGE I MERDAT: (1) the\nSAGE I instrument data, (2) the spacecraft and solar ephemeris data,\nand (3) NOAA NMC temperature and density interpolations from the\nstandard NMC spatial gridded analyses at the 18 standard pressure\nlevels and at the tropopause for each tangent event location.\nThe MERDAT files are used as the data input to the inversion process.\nAt the completion of the data processing, three Level 2 SAGE I\nproducts are produced: aerosol extinction profiles, ozone\nconcentration profiles, and nitrogen dioxide concentration profiles.\nThe SAGE1_AERO_PRF_NAT data set contains three years of aerosol\nextinction profiles data.  Each granule consists of three months of\ndata (seasonal data) which is in the SAGE I's native binary format.\nThe data coverage begins February 1979 and extends through November\n1981.  Data are stored in event format.  Each measurement event\nconsists of 48 parameters (does not include spares).\nThe SAGE1_AERO_PRF data set contains three years of aerosol extinction\nprofiles data.  Each granule consists of one month of data.  These\ndata are in Hiearchical Data Format (HDF).  The data coverage begins\nFebruary 1979 and extends through November 1981.  Data are stored in\nparameter format.  Each measurement event consists of 38 parameters.\nThe Ozone Concentration Profiles data set is not currently available\nat the Langley DAAC.  It will be archived in Hierarchical Data Format\n(HDF).\nThe Nitrogen Dioxide Concentration Profiles data set is not currently\navailable at the Langley DAAC.

            "definition": "Seasonal Ecological Analysis of Seafloor Organic Nutrient Supplies (SEASONS) is an ongoing study to investigate the impact of seasonality on benthic foraminiferal communities of the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). The WAP, in particular the northern Gerlache-southern Bransfield Straits, displays strong seasonality in primary productivity due largely to seasonal sea ice conditions and light availability. These extremes in primary productivity result in significant differences in organic flux to the sea floor. Cruises SEASONS I and II were devoted to sampling surface and near surface sediments in mid-April and late June, 2008 for foraminiferal, sedimentological, pore water, and geochemical analyses. Samples were collected across a productivity gradient, and at shallow (~600 meters) and deep (~1200 meters) water depths in the northern Gerlache-southern Bransfield Straits. Foraminiferal samples were treated to identify specimens containing protoplasm (living) at the time of collection with a protein marker, CellTracker Green and biological stain, Rose Bengal. Foraminiferal samples will be used to determine the seasonal impact on the population dynamics of the foraminiferal communities, and to assess seasonal impact on the geochemical properties of the biogenic carbonate. Additional samples were collected for organic carbon and sedimentological analyses. Pore waters were collected from the sediments for geochemical analyses. Results of these analyses will further our understanding of the environmental controls on foraminiferal geochemistry and distributions, extensively used proxies for paleoceanographic/paleoclimatic interpretations.\n\nhttps://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2008AM/finalprogram/abstract_150687.htm",

The scientific objective of the SAM II experiment was to develop a stratospheric aerosol data base for the polar regions by measuring and mapping vertical profiles of the atmospheric extinction due to aerosols.  This data base allows for studies of aerosol changes due to seasonal and short-term meteorological variations, atmospheric chemistry, cloud microphysics, volcanic activity and other perturbations.  The results obtained are useful in a number of applications, particularly the evaluation of any potential climatic effect caused by stratospheric aerosols. \n \nProject Description: The SAM II instrument consists of a single-channel Sun photometer with a 0.04 micron passband centered at a wavelength of 1.0 micron.  This is a region of the spectrum where absorption by atmospheric gases is negligible; consequently, any attenuation of sunlight is due to scattering by aerosol particles and air molecules. In operation, the instrument is activated shortly before each sunrise or sunset encountered by the satellite.  A sensor with a wide field-of-view is used to indicate the Sun's presence.  Two similar sensors then point the SAM II to within +-0.03 degrees in azimuth (left and right).  A mirror begins a rapid vertical scan until the Sun's image is acquired by the SAM II telescope.  The mirror then slowly scans vertically across the Sun at a rate of 0.25 degree per second reversing itself each time a Sun-limb crossing occurs.  The entrance window to the SAM II telescope only passes sunlight of wavelengths greater than 0.9 micron.  A circular aperture placed at the image plane serves to define the instantaneous field of view of the instrument to be 0.5 minute of arc.  This corresponds to a vertical resolution in the atmosphere of approximately 0.5 km altitude.  From the telescope, the light is directed through an interference filter, which rejects all but the 1.0 micron wavelength (+-0.02 micron) passband, to a photodiode detector.  The solar intensity as a function of time is digitized, recorded, and periodically telemetered back to Earth.  A description of the SAM II instrument, and of the experiment in general, is given by McCormick et al.  (1979).  The SAM II instrument, along with a number of other sensors, is mounted on the Nimbus 7 Earth-orbiting spacecraft.  The orbital characteristics of this spacecraft determine the frequency and geographic locations of the SAM II measurements.  The mode of operation of the SAM II instrument is such that it takes data during each sunrise and sunset encountered.  The Nimbus 7 spacecraft has an orbital period of 104 minutes, which means that it circles the Earth nearly 14 times per day.  There is a measurement opportunity for the SAM II each time that the spacecraft enters into or emerges from the Earth's shadow.  Consequently, the instrument takes data during approximately 14 sunrises and 14 sunsets each Earth day.  The Nimbus 7 spacecraft was placed in a high-noon, Sun-synchronous orbit; that is, the spacecraft crossed the Equator during each orbit at local noon. In general terms, this means that the orbital plane of the spacecraft was fixed with respect to the Sun, and thus all sunsets occur in the Arctic region and all sunrises occur in the Antarctic region. In the course of a single day, measurements of the stratospheric aerosol are obtained at 14 points spaced 26 degrees apart in longitude in the Arctic region and similarly for the Antarctic region. All the points obtained during 1 day in a given region are at very nearly the same latitude, but as time progresses, the latitudes of the measurements slowly change with the season by 1 to 2 degrees each week, gradually sweeping out the area from approximately 64.0 to 83.0 degrees.  The lowest latitude coverage occurs at the solstices whereas the highest latitudes are measured at the equinoxes. In the course of 1 week, therefore, the instrument makes about 98 measurements in each region, all in a band of latitude of approximately 1.0 degree.  These measurements give a fairly spatially dense set of data points.  When the locations of all the measurements obtained in one week are plotted on a geographic set of axes, one finds that the separation between points is only about 4.0 degrees in longitude. In a 6-month period of time, the total number of observations is on the order of 5000. However, due to an orbit degradation associated with the Nimbus 7 spacecraft, there has been a change and disruption in the collection of SAM II data beginning in 1987.  During the period of time from 1987 through 1993, orbital precession caused the Nimbus 7 spacecraft to cross the equator earlier than the planned high-noon crossing.  This gradually moved the Antarctic coverage equatorward and the maximum latitudinal Arctic coverage slightly poleward.  Initially the Antarctic latitudinal coverage extended from the lowest latitude, 64.5 degrees at the solstices, to the highest latitude, 81.0 degrees at the equinoxes.  By 1992 the Antarctic coverage gradually shifted to extend from 53.1 degrees at the solstices, to 69.2 degrees at the equinoxes. In the Arctic region the initial latitudinal coverage extended from the lowest latitude, 64.1 degrees at the solstices, to the highest latitude, 83.0 degrees at the equinoxes.  Gradually by 1991 the highest Arctic latitudinal coverage extended to 86.2 degrees at the equinoxes. \n\nThe orbital precession also affected the spacecraft orientation and prevented the SAM II instrument from acquiring the Sun for certain periods of time.  In the Arctic region many sunset events were lost because an S-band antenna blocked SAM II's view to the Sun.  Sunset events were lost for the following periods of time: mid-June through mid-August 1988; mid-March through mid-September 1989; mid-January through September 1990; and from January 7, 1991, through the present. In the Antarctic region the SAM II instrument was not able to acquire the Sun for the period of time from mid-January through October 1993. The final 2 months of SAM II data for the Antarctic region were collected during November and December 1993, and no further data is expected beyond 1993. Data Used and Produced: The SAM II satellite data are processed after being telemetered to the ground, with the data on solar intensity versus time being mathematically inverted to yield extinction coefficient versus altitude (extinction profile) for each sunrise or sunset event.  The mathematical inversion used is described by Chu and McCormick (1979). The basic data product, therefore, is the extinction profile obtained during each measurement opportunity, which can be analyzed to determine the spatial and temporal variations in the upper tropospheric and stratospheric aerosol.  These extinction data are archived at the Langley Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC), NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, after being subjected to an extensive validation program including comparisons with correlative aerosol observations.  A detailed description of the archived data products is given in the SAM II Data User's Guide (Chu et al.,1988). The SAM2_AERO_PRF_NAT data set contains over 15 years of polar Arctic and Antarctic aerosol profiles obtained with the SAM II satellite experiment.  The data coverage begins October 1978 and extends through December 1993.  For each measurement event, vertical profiles of extinction km-1, extinction km-1 uncertainty, extinction ratio, extinction ratio uncertainty, NMC temperature, temperature uncertainty, and pressure are provided as a function of altitude. Questionable profiles identified using the procedures described in the SAM II Data User's Guide have been removed from this data set.  In addition, a small number of events displaying incorrect measurement locations were deleted.\n      \nProject Archive Contact:  Langley DAAC User Services Office\n                                        Mail Stop 157D\n                                        NASA Langley Research Center\n                                        Hampton, VA 23681-0001\n                                        USA\n                                        Phone: (757) 864-8656\n                                        FAX:   (757) 864-8807\n                                        Email: larc@eos.nasa.gov\n                                        Home Page: http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/\n      \nProject Manager Contact:  M.

            "definition": "Stardust is the first U.S. space mission dedicated solely to the\nexploration of a comet, and the first robotic mission designed\nto return extraterrestrial material from outside the orbit of\nthe Moon.\n\nThe Stardust spacecraft was launched on February 7, 1999, from\nCape Canaveral Air Station, Florida, aboard a Delta II\nrocket. The primary goal of Stardust is to collect dust and\ncarbon-based samples during its closest encounter with Comet\nWild 2 - pronounced 'Vilt 2' after the name of its Swiss\ndiscoverer - is a rendezvous scheduled to take place in January\n2004, after nearly four years of space travel.\n\nAdditionally, the Stardust spacecraft will bring back samples of\ninterstellar dust, including recently discovered dust streaming\ninto our Solar System from the direction of Sagittarius. These\nmaterials are believed to consist of ancient pre-solar\ninterstellar grains and nebular that include remnants from the\nformation of the Solar System. Analysis of such fascinating\ncelestial specks is expected to yield important insights into\nthe evolution of the Sun its planets and possibly even the\norigin of life itself.\n\nIn order to meet up with comet Wild 2, the spacecraft will make\nthree loops around the Sun. On the second loop, its trajectory\nwill intersect the comet. During the meeting, Stardust will\nperform a variety of tasks including reporting counts of comet\nparticles encountered by the spacecraft with the Dust Flux\nMonitor, and real-time analyses of the compositions of these\nparticles and volatiles taken by the Comet and Interstellar Dust\nAnalyzer (CIDA). Using a substance called aerogel, Stardust will\ncapture these samples and store them for safe keep on its long\njourney back to Earth. This silica-based, material has been\ninserted within the Aerogel Collector Grid, which is similar to\na large tennis racket. Not until January 2006, will Stardust and\nits precise cargo return by parachuting a reentry capsule\nweighing approximately 125 pounds to the Earth's surface.\n\nStardust is the fourth NASA Discovery mission to be chosen and\nfollows on the heels of Mars Pathfinder, the Near Earth Asteroid\nRendezvous (NEAR) mission, and the Lunar Prospector\nmission. Discovery is an ongoing program that is intended to\noffer the scientific community opportunities to accomplish\nfrequent, high quality scientific investigations using\ninnovative and efficient management approaches. It seeks to keep\nperformance high and expenses low by using new technologies and\nstrict cost caps.\n\nThe Stardust Mission is a collaborative effort between NASA,\nuniversity and industry partners:\n\nThe Principal Investigator is Dr. Donald E. Brownlee of the\nUniversity of Washington, well known for his discovery of cosmic\nparticles in the stratosphere known as Brownlee Particles. He\nalso co-authored the bestseller Rare Earth : Why Complex Life Is\nUncommon, which puts forward a hypothesis predicting that\nsimple, microbial life will be widespread in the universe, while\ncomplex animal or plant life will be extremely rare.\n\nDr. Peter Tsou of the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), innovator in\naerogel technology serves as Deputy Investigator.\n\nThe contractor for the Stardust spacecraft is Lockheed Martin\nAstronautics, Denver, Colorado.\n\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory has an experienced project\nmanagement team, led by Thomas C. Duxbury. In addition, JPL\nprovided the optical navigation camera.\n\nThe Max Planck Institute (MPI) of Germany provided the real-time\ndust composition analyzer for the spacecraft.\n\nAmes Research Center provided the heat shield.\n\nJohnson Space Center will provide the planetary materials\ncuratorial facility where the samples can be preserved and tests\nconducted.\n\nUniversity of Chicago provided the Navigation Camera.\n\nFor more information,\nlink to the STARDUST main page at 'http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/'\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]",

The study area extended from\neastern Kansas to theAtlantic seaboard and from mid-Alabama to\nsoutheastern Canada, an area of approximately 2,400 by 1,000 km.  The\nstudy was motivated by concerns in the early 1970s that suspended\nsulfates impair human health when inhaled in a mixture of pollutant\ngases and other suspended particulate components.  Since then it has\nbeen established that adverse health effects are not associated with\nambient sulfate concentrations as formerly thought.  However, sulfur\noxides and their copollutants, nitrogen oxides, may have roles in\ngoverning the acidity of the atmosphere and precipitation, and in\nimpairing visibility, but these aspects of air quality were not\nstudied explicitly in the SURE project.\nThe primary objectives of the SURE project were:\n1) Establish a regional air quality data base through measurements of\nseveral parameters at the ground and aloft with specified accuracy and\nprecision, and evaluate the adequacy of the measurements selected for\nestablishing the origins of the sulfur oxide particulate complex.\n2) Establish the location and magnitude of emissions occurring during\nthe air quality measurement period with specified accuracy and\nprecision.  In addition to sulfur oxides the emissions inventory\nincluded the nitrogen oxides, gaseous hydrocarbons and particles.\n3) Derive a quantitative method for relating emissions from the\nelectric power industry to regional ambient air quality as measured by\nsulfur dioxide and particulate sulfate.  Using this method establishes\nthe relative importance of emission density distribution, meteorology,\nchemical transformations, and removal processes to the regional\noccurrence of sulfur and nitrogen oxides.\nContinuous air quality measurements were obtained at 9 Class I\nstations from August 1977 through June 1979.

            "definition": "Ten tensor magnetotelluric (MT) soundings have been acquired in a 54 km long profile across the South Pole area, East Antarctica. The MT transect was offset from the South Pole station ∼5 km and oriented 210 grid north, approximately normal to the Trans-Antarctic Mountains. Surveying around South Pole station was pursued for four main reasons. First, we sought to illuminate first-order structure and physico-chemical state (temperatures, fluids, melts) of the crust and upper mantle of this part of East Antarctica. Secondly, conditions around the South Pole differ from those of previous MT experience at central West Antarctica, so that the project would help to define MT surveying feasibility over the entire continent. Thirdly, the results would provide a crustal response baseline for possible long-term MT monitoring to deep upper mantle depths at the South Pole. Fourthly, because Antarctic logistics are difficult, support facilities at the South Pole enable relatively efficient survey procedures. In making the MT measurements, the high electrical contact impedance at the electrode-firn interface was overcome using a custom-design electrode pre-amplifier at the electrode with low output impedance to the remainder of the recording electronics. Non-plane-wave effects in the data were suppressed using a robust jackknife procedure that emphasized outlier removal from the vertical magnetic field records. Good quality data were obtained, but the rate of collection was hampered by low geomagnetic activity and wind-generated, electrostatic noise induced in the ice. Profile data were inverted using a 2-D algorithm that damps model departures from an a priori structure, in this case a smooth 1-D profile obtained from inversion of an integral of the TM mode impedance along the profile. Inverse models show clear evidence for a pronounced (∼1 km thickness), conductive section below the ice tentatively correlated with porous sediments of the Beacon Supergroup. Substantial variations in sedimentary conductance are inferred, which may translate into commensurate variations in sediment thickness. Low resistivities below ∼30 km suggest thermal activity in the lower crust and upper mantle, and mantle support for this region of elevated East Antarctica. This contrasts with resistivity structure imaged previously in central West Antarctica, where resistivity remains high into the upper mantle consistent with a fossil state of extensional activity there.\n\nhttp://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118792635/abstract",

One of the main objectives of the SGP is to produce the necessary observations to realize a Terrestrial Reference Frame that has an accuracy of 1 mm (decadal scale) with stability at 0.1 mm/year (annual scale). This is an ambitious goal, as it represents an order of magnitude improvement over the current capability.\n\nNASA's Space Geodesy Program encompasses the development, deployment, operation, and maintenance of a global network of space geodetic observatories consisting of geodetic and associated instruments, a data collection and transfer system, analysis, and the public dissemination of data products required to maintain a stable terrestrial reference system, measure the Earth Orientation Parameters, and support NASA’s missions and the scientific community.",

The goal was to improve satellite applications for Earth-bound decisions, such as 'should we evacuate the coast because of the hurricane?'.\n\nThe TIROS Program's first priority was the development of a meteorological satellite information system. Weather forecasting was deemed the most promising application of space-based observations.\n\nTIROS proved extremely successful, providing the first accurate weather forecasts based on data gathered from space. TIROS began continuous coverage of the Earth's weather in 1962, and was used by meteorologists worldwide.

The source(s) of model error are difficult to isolate in complex terrain with limited atmospheric or land-surface observations. Further complications arise from the gross scale mismatch between ESM grid box sizes and the relevant scales of mountainous hydrological processes. The mountain hydrometeorology community has repeatedly called for integrated atmospheric and surface observations of water and energy budgets in complex terrain that span these scales to establish benchmarks against which scale-dependent models can be developed. In response to these calls, the Surface Atmosphere Integrated Field Laboratory (SAIL) will make measurements using the second ARM Mobile Facility (AMF2) and a scanning X-band dual polarimetric radar near Crested Butte, Colorado. The campaign will focus on the East River Watershed, which is a 300-km2 mountainous watershed that is part of the Upper Colorado River Basin. SAIL will advance atmosphere-through-bedrock understanding of mountainous water cycles by collocating ARM atmospheric observations with long-standing collaborative resources including the ongoing surface and subsurface hydrologic observations from the Department of Energy’s Watershed Function Science Focus Area (SFA). The main science goal of the SAIL campaign is to develop a quantitative understanding of the atmosphere and land-atmosphere interaction processes, at their relevant scales, that impact mountain hydrology in the midlatitude continental interior of the United States.",

Its study area included a 640-square-mile (1,656-square-kilometer) area in Santa Barbara County and the coastal Pacific waters. The primary goal of the SHIFT campaign was to collect a repeated dense time series of airborne Visible to ShortWave Infrared (VSWIR) airborne imaging spectroscopy data with coincident field measurements in both inland terrestrial and coastal aquatic areas, supported in part by a broad team of research collaborators at academic institutions. The SHIFT campaign leveraged NASA’s Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) facility instrument to collect approximately weekly VSWIR imagery across the study area. The SHIFT campaign 1) enables the NASA SBG team to conduct traceability analyses related to science value of VSWIR revisit without relying on multispectral proxies, 2) enables testing algorithms for consistent performance over seasonal time scales and end-to-end workflows including community distribution, and 3) provide early adoption test cases to SHIFT application users and incubate relationships with basic and applied science partners at the University of California Santa Barbara Sedgwick Reserve and The Nature Conservancy’s Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve.",

It used two\n NASA aircraft, a DC-8 and a P-3B. Its central objective was to\n improve knowledge of the factors controlling ozone, OH,\n aerosols, and related species over the vast and remote region\n defined by the tropical Pacific. Both aircraft were equipped\n with extensive instrumentation for measuring numerous chemical\n compounds and gases. The geographical coverage ranged from 38N\n to 36S in latitude and 148W to 76E in longitude. Major\n deployment sites included Hilo, Hawaii; Christmas Island;\n Tahiti; Fiji; and Easter Island. PEM-Tropics B was a sequel to\n PEM-Tropics A, conducted in September-October 1996. The latter\n field study encountered considerable biomass burning indluence\n over the South Pacific associated with the dry season in the\n southern tropics. PEM-Tropics B, conducted in the wet season of\n the so!  uthern tropics, observed an exceedingly clean\n atmosphere over the South Pacific but a variety of pollution\n influences over the tropical North Pacific, including\n long-range transport from industrial sources in Eurasia and\n North America as well as from seasonal biomass burning in\n Southeast Asia. Photochemical ozone loss over both the North\n and the South Pacific exceeded local photochemical production\n by about a factor of two, implying the need for a major inflow\n term to balance the tropospheric budget over the\n region. Dedicated flights investigated the sharp air mass\n transitions at the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and at\n the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). Extensive OH\n observations, many involving diurnal profiles at several\n different altitudes, permitted the first large-scale\n comparisons with photochemical model predictions. High\n concentrations of oxygenated organics were observed\n ubiquitously in the tropical Pacific atmosphere and may have\n important implicat!  ions for global HOx and NOx\n budgets. Extensive equatorial measurements of DSMS and OH, some\n of which were recorded in coincidence with exceptionally high\n levels of the oxidation product DMSO, suggest that important\n aspects of marine sulfur chemistry are also still poorly\n understood.\n\n Provided by:\n\n Raper, J.L., M.M.

This project will instrument 100 belugas per year over three years with satellite transmitters and, in some locations, oceanographic data loggers, to obtain a synoptic snapshot of the pattern and timing of beluga movements in relation to sea ice, surface temperature, primary productivity, bathymetry, as well as temperature and salinity at depth through beluga dive profiles. This baseline data will be invaluable information against which to make comparisons through time as the Arctic undergoes climate change. \nBy serving as autonomous underwater samplers, belugas will collect oceanographic data at depth in regions of particular interest, such as polynyas, during winter months when ship-based collection of such data would be difficult, dangerous, or impossible. Such data can assist oceanographers with modeling ocean temperatures, salinity, currents, heat exchange, formation of deep and intermediate waters.and rates of change that may aid in our understanding patterns relating to climate change. \nBelugas will be tagged across their range in Svalbard, Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland, which will help delineate stock structure, particularly where ranges overlap but beluga migration patterns are distinct. Little is currently known about beluga stocks in Russia, so this study will make an important contribution in that area. Local arctic peoples and young scientists in training in each region will participate in the fieldwork, educational outreach, and or, data analysis. Tissue samples, measurements, and other data will be collected from each tagged beluga to aid in auxiliary studies. Finally, establishment of a real-time web-based display of beluga movements will be a window for the public through which to view this fascinating research. There will also be an educational DVD, magazine, film and aquarium exhibits produced to interpret this important science.",

They can cope with extreme temperatures, varying light intensities, as well as low availability of essential nutrients and other resources. Microalgae constitute a potential resource useful in biotechnological applications and they have an important advantage over many other organisms as they can be expediently cultured for the production and processing of desirable compounds. Culturing of microalgae and their maintenance in a culture collection as a stable renewable resource is a huge advantage in the development of their value to biotechnology. The promising application, with a possible turn-up both for the public health and for the safeguard of the ambient, is definitely the utilization of microalgae as a source of bioactive substances. Recently, much effort has been expended on the search for new compounds of therapeutic potential, demonstrating that microalgae of all classes possess antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer activities. There is also a number of different modes in which microalgae are utilised in aquaculture: a) as feed to supply basic nutrients; b) as a source of pigments to improve the colour of fish; c) for other biological purposes. Some prospects for new chemicals have been reported in recent years, the most prominent of which are carotenoids of nutritional and medical value, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), polysaccharides, peptides and radical scavengers. \nEven though, the cultivation scale-up of microalgae in polar regions seem to be difficult due to the harsh climatic conditions, on the basis of preliminary experiments, we propose an innovative step to develop microalgal photobioreactors for extreme environmental conditions, which could potentially help to develop local industry and at the same time provide a viable means of treating domestic wastewaters generated by local communities. Various types of photobioreactors (both closed and semi-closed systems) are to be constructed and tested in various parts of the Arctic Region. This might lay the basis of sustainable biotechnology to cultivate local native strains, which offer a rich source of food additives and other bioactive substances. It is proposed that the experiments will be carried out at the Canadian base of Ellesmere Island and at the Italian base of Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. It is expected that in the future, cultivation studies will be extended to Antarctic Region at the Italian (Mario Zucchelli Station), Czech (James Ross Island) and Indian (Schirmacher Oases) bases. \nAlthough the programme seems to be very ambitious and difficult to realize, once the prototypes of the photobioreactors are experimented in both bipolar regions, the feasibility of growing the algae and cyanobacteria for food and bio-products could become in a reality. The project will develop innovative field mass culture units, which aims to optimize light energy utilization and minimize environmental impact, potentially integrating with existing polar infrastructure and associated nutrient and energy sources. Moreover, it will establish or add to valuable bio-geographical, taxonomic, physiological, biochemical and genetic parameters for polar micro-algae. Microalgae are also key resources to wastewater treatment systems, where they remove nutrients and contaminants. For exemple, this process has been already applied to bioremediate mining sites in Artic Canada. It may be possible, therefore, to use infrastructure and wastewater from polar town sites and industrial operations, and integrate photobioreactors into future urban/industrial development. A web site will be created, with links to all academic, university and industrial partners raising individual establishment profiles and highlight ecological benefits. \nThe team will involve collaboration among Canada, Italy, Czech Republic, India and potentially other interested nations. In principle this project is continuation of existing research studies conducted recently and in the past (both in Arctic and Antarctic) by different members of the team. The exploitation of polar based bio-active metabolites is a new and innovative proposal, as is the biotechnology of outdoor studies with polar phototrophic strains.",

The knowledge of positive and negative feedbacks in the system climate-vegetation-soil-permafrost are of the crucial significance for understanding and forecasting response of this system to global change.\nRASCHER addresses how climate variability and change can affect the soil systems of the polar (Subarctic and Arctic) regions and their sustainability. To provide accurate projections on the impact of climate change and increase of anthropogenic influence on these systems requires improved knowledge of its components and their linkages. Soil has both very inert and changeable parameters, which are altered differently because of climate change. RASCHER will mainly focus on the study of temporal change of labile soil characteristics (temperature, carbon fluxes and other gas fluxes, microbiota and microfauna) and of more stable soil characteristics (mineral composition, organic matter content and quality, morphological features, taxonomical status) in different kinds of frontiers (treeline, tundra-bog border, southern border of permafrost, contact zone of soil and permafrost table in a profile), which are expected to be changed first due to climate change. Together with climate-induced change the influence of the other regional and international processes shift of resource development, increased tourism and relevant infrastructure to the north on permafrost-affected soils will be studied. RASCHER will be based on both database analysis and field studies. The database on soil temperatures for dozens of meteorological stations of arctic and boreal regions for the period 50-100 years and the northern circumpolar soil database are already compiled and can be used for analysis. The field studies will be carried out in the different regions of Arctic and Subarctic during 2006-2008. To understand the effects of global change on northern polar soils firstly the long-term climatic trends and correlation of air and soil temperatures on the various depths will be carried out and the relevant models will be developed. Using the prognosis for climate change the spatial model of soil temperature change in northern polar latitudes will be elaborated. \nThe potential development of northern industries, settlements and transport infrastructure (roads, pipelines) relevant to soil change will be forecasted together with social geographers and specialists in land management. The analysis of previously gained data on anthropogenic impact on permafrost-affected soils and field work in relevant human-changed environments will allow to elaborate the spatial prognostic model of anthropogenic change of Arctic and Subarctic soils. The Northern circumpolar soil database will help to differentiate this forecast related to kinds of soils and substrate. \nThe role of thermal factor in composition and functioning of the biotic complex of tundra soils (microbiota, micro- and mesofauna) as well as the selective role of negative temperatures on the structure of soil microbiocenoses and the influence of cryogenesis on adaptive functions of soil microorganisms will be studied both in the field and in a laboratory using traditional and new (DNA analysis) methods. It allows comparing new data with results of studies carried out at the same locations 30-40 years ago and assessing if any climate-induced change of soil biota has taken place. The samples collected from the same places as 20 years ago will be analyzed for the 14C activity and the soil carbon renovation rates will be calculated (Cherkinsky-Brovkin model) and then will be compared with old samples to find out if it is any acceleration of carbon turnover due to global change. \nThe frontier studies will concern the non-stability of soil thermic regimes, shrinking of isolated patches and the northward retreat of permafrost-affected soils, the assessments of possible soil change related to the vegetation transformation on the base of soil studies (carbon fluxes, humus quality, mineral composition, etc.) in different types of ecotones (forest-tundra, tundra-bog, forest-meadow, forest-bog, meadow-tundra). The other part of frontier studies is the detailed analysis of soil process at the interface of soil and permafrost tables. It concerns the study of the bio- and geochemical barrier on this interface and the study of the process of cryogenic lateral transportation at the contact zone of soil and permafrost table.

An effort to quantify direct and indirect climate forcing by polar aerosols will be made through a set of closure experiments using observations in conjunction with model calculation and satellite data.\nThe co-operation in the frame of POLAR-AOD will allow the following: \n1. - Definition of calibration procedures among the various sun-radiometers operating in Polar regions, in order to achieve homogeneous AOD (aerosol optical depth) evaluations and maintain a set of reference instruments in a high mountain station. Some of the instruments will be used to constitute a traveller system from one station to the other with the aim of attaining round robin inter-comparison. Regular inter-comparison campaigns (biennial) will be organized in order to compare not only calibration constants but also instrumental characteristics, such as sensitivity and influence of diffuse light. The first inter-comparison campaign, scheduled for spring 2006 at Ny-Alesund, will be used also to define and adjust the methodology and calculation procedures, like that aimed at evaluating relative optical air mass and trace-gas corrections.\n2 . - Improvement of 'in-situ' optical and chemical measurements, with an effort to operate size and time-resolved aerosol composition and concentration sampling on a long-term base (EoI ID 557).\n3. - Establishment of a data bank for spectral sun-photometric measurements (AOD archive), in-situ measurements and any other aerosol related parameters useful for assessing the quantification of aerosols and their radiative effects. This archive will fill the gap for the polar regions within the global aerosol climatology, where there is an urgent need for high-quality data on aerosol abundance and physico-chemical characteristics on a regional scale. The information is necessary to better constrain climate model simulations and improve the interpretation of remotely sensed data. Particular attention will be paid to retrospective analyses of historical data-sets, mainly from Russian Arctic and Antarctic stations. They will be recovered and stored in the archive.\n4. - Determination of reliable procedures for analysing sun-photometric and sun-radiometric data in order to describe realistically the specific conditions occurring in the polar regions. Standard programmes will be developed and supplied to the research groups involved, including cloud rejection algorithms and radiometric data analysis.\n5 - Organisation of international workshops for the presentation of the results from the various polar programs, and for the discussion of common strategies and goals, including aspects of logistics within inter-calibration activities and data exchange.\nIn Antarctica, the actual field activities will benefit from the setting up of a new international long-term monitoring programme, called TAVERN (Quantification of Tropospheric Aerosol and Thin Clouds Variability, including Radiation Budget over the East Antarctic Plateau) at the recently established Italian-French station Dome Concordia (EoI ID 198). Year-round measurements based on LIDAR, Sun and Star photometer and &in-situ& aerosol systems will make it possible to study in detail inter-annual and seasonal variation of aerosols over the high Antarctic Plateau, and also to obtain information on the thin cloud optical depth. The normal activities in other stations will be extended during the IPY operational period (EoI ID 797). The POLAR-AOD observations will complement the SRB measurements which are developed at other stations (Syowa, South Pole, Neumayer) in the frame of the BSRN (GCOS) activities, providing an important contribution for assessing forcing by aerosols.\nIn the Arctic, additional strong field activities will be promoted at the Greenland Summit Station (EoI ID 530) and Tiksi (EoI ID 820), during the IPY operational period. Real-time measurements of physical, chemical and optical properties of aerosols will allow the constitution of a data set in the Arctic, equivalent to the one acquired over the Antarctic Plateau, Summit being a natural counterpart of Dome Concordia. Also in Ny-Alesund, research activities related to aerosols will increase as a consequence of the efforts of Norway, Poland, Germany, Japan and Italy (EoIs ID 165, ID 597). The network will give support in obtaining high-quality integrated data from the large amount of field activities. Participation on cruises organised in the framework of the Arctic Experiment (AREX) and the airborne ASTAR (Arctic Study of Tropospheric Aerosol, Clouds, and Radiation) activities will lead to a considerable improvement in knowledge on the vertical and spatial distribution of aerosols in the European Arctic. The present studies will complement the activities promoted by the SEARCH Program (NOAA's Study of Environmental Arctic Change). Finally the information obtained will allow participants to assess the influence of mid-latitude aerosol sources in the observed Arctic aerosol budget. \nPOLAR-AOD (EoIs ID 299, ID 557) will join the efforts of the IASOA proposal (EoI ID 138), in the task of co-ordinating different programmes of long-term atmospheric observatories in the Arctic with the purpose of setting up a circumpolar ring around the central Arctic region. The second aim is to fulfil the need for an integrated larger bi-polar network in the field of atmospheric sciences.",

Braconnot, 9-24, 2000. ]\n\nAtmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) are continually improving in their ability to simulate the major features of today´s climate. Many of these models are being used to predict future climate change and although there is broad agreement among the models, there are also many differences in the details of their predictions. In order to determine whether models can simulate climatic conditions much different from today, the models can be used to simulate paleoclimates, and paleodata can be used to evaluate the results. Moreover, AGCMs have proved their usefulness to investigate mechanisms of past climate changes (e.g., Joussaume, 1999)). The Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) was initiated in order to coordinate and encourage the systematic study of AGCMs and to assess their ability to simulate large changes of climate such as those that occurred in the distant past. It also is serving to encourage the preparation of global reconstructions of paleoclimates that can be used to evaluate climate models.\n\nThe PMIP effort developed out of a NATO Advanced Research Workshop, convened in 1991, which led to a cooperative and coordinated effort to compare model simulations with paleoclimate data. The workshop participants agreed to focus initially on two specific periods in the past : the last glacial maximum, 21 000 years before present (BP), and the mid-Holocene climate, 6 000 years BP, which correspond to extreme conditions that are relatively well documented. Simulating the last glacial maximum provides an opportunity for assessing the models´ ability to simulate extreme cold conditions as well as for studying the feedbacks associated with both a decrease of the atmospheric CO2 concentration and ice sheet elevation of 2 to 3 km above North America and northern Europe. The simulation of the mid-Holocene conditions is on the other hand a sensitivity experiment in which the seasonal contrast of incoming solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere is changed; 6000 years BP, the seasonal contrast was larger in the northern summer, leading to an increase of summer monsoons over Africa and South Asia.\n\nMore Information: http://pmip.lsce.ipsl.fr/",

            "definition": "Esecutive Summary of Project:\n\n\n Over its ten-year lifetime, the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere\n (TOGA) program (1985-1995) made major strides toward\n understanding the El Ni?o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\n phenomenon, which impacts surface air temperature and rainfall\n over many regions of the globe. In particular, TOGA\n demonstrated the feasibility of operational\n seasonal-to-interannual climate prediction of equatorial\n Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies based on numerical\n models that simulate, in a rudimentary manner, the physics of\n the coupled tropical ocean-atmosphere system, and it clarified\n the nature of the remote, planetary-scale atmospheric response\n to these anomalies. The U.S. Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land\n System (GOALS) program is predicated on the belief that the\n skill of operational climate prediction can be further\n increased by continued research on ENSO and by efforts to\n understand other elements of the climate system that contribute\n to the observed seasonal-to-interannual variability. The !  Pan\n American Climate Studies (PACS) program is a component of the\n U.S. GOALS program in the 1995-2005 time frame, and PACS\n provides a phenomenological context for some of the GOALS\n research.\n\n\n The overall goal of PACS is to extend the scope and improve the\n skill of operational seasonal-to-interannual climate prediction\n over the Americas. Particular emphasis is placed on warm season\n rainfall, which is not yet predictable. In the context of PACS,\n climate prediction is concerned not only with seasonal mean\n rainfall and temperature, but also with the frequency of\n occurrence of significant weather events such as hurricanes or\n floods over the course of a season or seasons.\n\n The scientific objectives of PACS are to promote a better\n understanding and more realistic simulation of (1) the boundary\n forcing of seasonal-to-interannual climate variations over the\n Americas, (2) the evolution of tropical sea surface temperature\n anomalies, (3) the seasonally varying mean climate over the\n Americas and adjacent ocean regions, (4) the time-dependent\n structure of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)/cold\n tongue complex, and (5) the relevant land surface processes.\n\n To state these objectives more explicitly:\n\n Boundary forcing: The atmospheric circulation, in isolation, is\n not predictable beyond a week or two. Hence, prospects for\n improved climate prediction on the seasonal-to-interannual time\n scale hinge on the ability to exploit the relationships between\n the planetary-scale atmospheric circulation and the slowly\n evolving and potentially predictable boundary forcing; i.e.,\n the fields of sea surface temperature, vegetation, and soil\n moisture, in which the season-to-season 'memory' of the coupled\n ocean-atmosphere-land system resides. Improved understanding of\n boundary-forced atmospheric anomalies is of central importance,\n not only to PACS, but to the entire GOALS program.\n\n Evolution of tropical sea surface temperature anomalies: For\n climate prediction of a season or more in advance, it is\n necessary to take into account the evolution of the boundary\n forcing of the atmosphere. In keeping with the general strategy\n of GOALS, PACS will seek to advance the state-of-the-art of the\n prediction of sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical\n Atlantic and Pacific, both of which are known to influence\n climate variability over parts of the Americas.\n\n Seasonally varying mean climate: Regional rainfall anomalies\n over the Americas are largely a reflection of the\n intensification or weakening, or subtle displacements in\n positions of the climatological-mean features that organize the\n rainfall, i.e., the monsoons, the oceanic ITCZs, and the\n tropical and extratropical cyclone tracks. An understanding of\n these robust climatological-mean features and their seasonal\n evolution is a prerequisite for the interpretation and\n prediction of the anomalies.\n\n Structure of the ITCZ/cold tongue complex: A major stumbling\n block in the validation of the models used to simulate tropical\n atmosphere-ocean interaction in ENSO is the lack of\n observational data for defining the structure of the ocean\n mixed layer and the overlying atmosphere in the ITCZ/cold\n tongue complex. PACS will address this deficiency through its\n field projects and the related modeling studies that will make\n use of these data.\n\n Land surface processes: The distribution of rainfall over the\n Americas is shaped, not only by sea surface temperature patterns\n but also by land surface processes, particularly during the warm\n season, when vegetation and soil moisture are highly\n influential. Orography and coastal geometry mediate these\n effects and leave a distinctive mesoscale imprint upon the\n rainfall patterns. These issues will be addressed in\n collaboration with the Global Energy and Water Experiment\n (GEWEX) and its regional programs, with PACS supplying the\n atmospheric modeling expertise and GEWEX the hydrological\n expertise. Much of this research will require the use of\n mesoscale models, applied in a climatological setting.\n\n PACS scientific objectives (1) and (2) directly address the\n scientific objectives of the GOALS program: (1) relates to\n atmospheric prediction and (2) to prediction of tropical sea\n surface temperature; in this sense they may be viewed as\n primary. Objectives (3)-(5) play a supportive role by advancing\n understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to and limit the\n predictability of the coupled global ocean-atmosphere-land\n system: (3) and (4) relate to the prediction of ENSO and other\n phenomena that give rise to tropical sea surface temperature\n anomalies, and (5) relates to the prediction of continental\n rainfall.\n\n PACS encompasses a broad range of activities, including\n empirical studies, data set development, modeling, climate\n monitoring, and more intensive, limited-term field\n experiments. In order to avoid being spread too thin, the field\n studies will focus on different regions of the Pan-American\n climate system in sequence. During the first five years they\n will focus on atmosphere-ocean interaction in the tropical\n eastern Pacific, in association with the ENSO cycle and the\n climatological-mean annual march. During the second half of\n PACS the emphasis will shift to the tropical Atlantic Ocean\n where the sea surface temperature anomalies are more subtle and\n more diverse in terms of horizontal structure than in the\n Pacific, but no less important in terms of their influence upon\n precipitation in the adjacent continental regions.\n\n This scientific prospectus/implementation plan provides the\n motivation and scientific basis for PACS and describes the\n research that will be carried out in pursuit of PACS scientific\n objectives. Section 1 gives a scientific description of\n phenomena in the ocean-atmosphere system that are likely to be\n of importance for understanding and predicting\n seasonal-to-interannual climate variations over the\n Americas. The climate and weather variations over the Americas\n that provide the practical and scientific motivation for PACS\n are discussed in Section 2, while Sections 3-5 describe the\n empirical studies, data set development, and modeling that will\n be conducted under its auspices. Section 6 describes field\n studies envisioned for PACS, starting with projects already\n funded and going on to describe activities likely to be\n proposed for the 1997-2000 time frame. Section 7 discusses\n linkages with GEWEX and its regional programs and NASA's\n Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM). Se!  ction 7 also\n describes the anticipated linkages with emerging national and\n international programs, including the Scripps-Lamont Consortium\n for the Ocean's Role in Climate (CORC), the Pilot Research\n Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA), the anticipated\n World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Climate Variability and\n Predictability (CLIVAR) international programs on the\n Variability of the American Monsoon Systems (VAMOS), and\n Pacific and Atlantic basinwide extended climate studies\n (BECS). Program management is discussed in Section 8. Within\n the U.S., interagency support is being sought for PACS, with\n coordination by the GOALS Project Office. The Inter-American\n Institute for Global Change Research serves as a vehicle for\n coordinating international cooperation.\n\n Contact Person:\n\n Candance Gudmundson\n gcg&#64atmos.washington.edu\n\n For more information,\n link to 'http://tao.atmos.washington.edu/pacs/'\n\n [Summary provided by JISAO]",

Being represented meant for the Sami that their lives and culture appeared stereotyped, because they inhabited areas that had been labelled as void from a scientific point of view ever since the time of Carl von Linné. The north was a place devoid of substance, which could therefore be filled with the explorers’ and researchers’ opinions and fantasies. During the nineteenth century, an interest in the exotic within the borders of the home nation was aroused, and in the process the Sami became objectified in travel writing. Polar travel writing formed part of the colonial project to conquer the northern parts of the Nordic countries, including Arctic areas. With reference to the Sami, this process provides us with simplified images. The representations of the Sami appear within a colonial discourse, in the form of depictions and explanations concerning the Arctic and the Sub-Arctic, and the people who inhabited these areas. It was common practice during the nineteenth century to discover “new” people and “new” cultures, and describe them, as a process of collecting information about them, and this was part of the colonial process as it was defined at that time. The depictions of the Sami in Sven Lovén’s travel journals from 1836-37, for instance, were mythical and ethnographical; they were also interwoven with perspectives on nature and the experience of being in an Arctic landscape that could be related to the Arctic sublime. There were also descriptions about the nature of the Sami, which could be connected to a three-dimensional layer of ethnocentrism, racism and exoticism. References to scientific works and literature also occurred in the text, but to a lesser extent. In other words, the several representations that existed at one and the same time may be divided into three themes that run parallel to one another in the travel writings of Lovén. References to scientific work were not so common in Lovén’s journals, and when they occurred they were usually dictionary references. Literature such as the epos Kalevala used, as references may be perceived as being of a mythical character. Other representations of a mythical character that related to the Sami were created in the context of socio-cultural descriptions, and may thus be perceived as ethnographic. The mythical and ethnographical representations were both embedded in romanticisation. Ethnographically coloured representations were common, for example, in art during the nineteenth century. These descriptions were close to the romantic view of the Sami. There were also descriptions of real dramas in the course voyages, and these may be detected as part of the Arctic sublime. In these descriptions, the Sami became a part of the Arctic sublime, since the Sami were perceived as able to interpret the behaviour of animals, which were part of the sublime. Depictions of the nature of the Sami formed another set of representations. The nature of the Sami is also connected to Sami society, described as being in opposition to Swedish/Western society, according to a racist perception of the Sami as being of a different race and nationality. Knowledge about the Sami decreased at the end of the nineteenth century, and this changed the image of the Sami to a more romantic perception, rather than a racist one. This romantic view was not part of the canon at the beginning of the nineteenth century, but it was nevertheless possible for this opinion to flourish. In travel writings from the nineteenth century it is clear that the travel writing contained personal opinions, which contaminated the text. People and cultures were designated as ‘the Other’ to define for the travellers what the former were not, i.e. Europeans. The stereotypical representations of the Sami may have been used to define what the explorers were not, in order not to risk becoming ‘the Other’ in the new and unknown environment that was the Arctic. Explorers were able to shift between representing Culture and being part of Nature at the same time. They never risked being estranged from themselves, since the otherness between Culture and Nature was inhabited by ‘the Other’. The in-between space was a place for explorers to get to know the wild man inside themselves, but since this space was already inhabited by ‘the Other’ this exploration could not get out of hand and result in the explorer turning into an alien being, or monster.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=30",

            "definition": "The goal of this project is to document pan-arctic changes in large-scale disturbances (thermokarst, fire, insect outbreaks, and forest harvest), relate these to climatic and social change, and to assess their ecological, climatic, and societal consequences in high-latitude ecosystems (tundra and boreal forest). Recent trends suggest that continued high-latitude warming will likely be accompanied by increases in disturbances such as fire, insect outbreaks, thermokarst, and potentially forest harvest and land-cover conversion to grassland or agriculture. These disturbances have qualitatively different effects on the climate system, ecological processes, and therefore society than do those ecological processes that are more continuous functions of climatic change. Large-scale disturbances have the practical advantage that they can be quantified regionally by remote sensing so processes studied locally are more readily extrapolated to large scales. The program builds on existing research programs in Alaska, Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia and on global remote-sensing and inventory programs. We choose a pan-arctic scale so we can relate our results to the functioning of arctic climate system and take advantage of geographic variation in climate and disturbance regime. We also build from national and site-based research programs and databases, providing the opportunity to link processes and local, regional, and global scales. We address the following questions:\n1. How have changes in climate affected disturbance regime across the arctic and boreal zones, and how have these changes in disturbance affected climate through changes in trace gas emissions, smoke, and energy exchange? Do feedbacks from land-surface processes to climate buffer or amplify the initial climate trends? In other words, what is the net effect of these high-latitude climate feedbacks on the global climate system? We currently have circumboreal databases of disturbances (fire, insects, and forest harvest), vegetation, climate (1900-2005; projected to 2100), and date of snowmelt, providing the datasets necessary to make preliminary estimates of high-latitude climate feedbacks. National programs will refine and improve these databases and develop climatic, geographic, and socioeconomic correlations as a basis for developing rules to estimate future disturbance rates.\n2. How do changes in disturbance regime affect post-disturbance ecosystem development and future disturbance probability? Are there thresholds in disturbance severity or size that trigger qualitatively different patterns of ecosystem development? For example, are there conditions where fire at treeline or insect outbreaks at the southern margin of the boreal forest lead to a permanent land-cover transition? We will rely on regional studies to develop simple models of post-disturbance succession for fire, logging, insects, and agriculture. We are particularly interested in circumstances that trigger radically different vegetation succession such as wet tundra to shrub tundra; tundra to forest; conifer to deciduous forest; or forest to grassland. Based on preliminary studies, we are confident we can develop these models.\n3. How have changes in disturbance regime and resulting changes in ecosystem structure and functioning affected ecosystem services on which society depends, and how have human activities (ignitions, suppression, and land-cover change) influenced the response of disturbance regime to climatic change? Many ecosystem services (timber, fuelwood, berries, moose, caribou, etc.) can be estimated from the interactive effects of climate and vegetation (stand type and age). Based on maps of climate and vegetation (#1) and disturbance frequency and successional trajectory (#2), we can estimate temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem services. Based on local and regional studies we can estimate the validity of these estimates and the extent to which they are influenced by other factors such as human harvest. We will then explore the social, economic and cultural bases for these human impacts on ecosystem services.\n4. How have policies changed in response to recent changes in climate and disturbance regime, and what factors influence the rigidity or flexibility of these policies and therefore the potential for adaptation or vulnerability at times of rapid change? Based on the patterns described above we will develop alternative scenarios of future ecosystem services (climate feedbacks and subsistence resources). We will explore with residents and policy makers policies that might influence the relative likelihood of these alternative scenarios.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=275",

Being a resident of the arctic, I clearly understand the utter need for practical research that will help to strengthen and improve the health and well-being of community life, and will contribute to making our communities more resilient to the impacts of climate change.\n\nAt the 2006 World Urban Forum it was acknowledged by global decision-makers that climate change will be one of the key challenges faced by human settlements across the world. The goal of this research node is to build capacity for sustainable community development in Arctic regions so they are less vulnerable, more liveable and stand a better chance of coping with challenges posed by climate change. In the Arctic, building this capacity requires a proactive approach, collaboration amongst a wide range of partners, integration of policies across scales (national, regional, local), accommodation of cultural priorities, and practical application of research. \n\nThis is reflected in the 2005 Research Needs Survey for Nunavut published by C-CIARN North. It states:\nThe survey results suggest that Nunavut community members recognize considerable overlap among climate change impacts and that they do not generally view climate change adaptation challenges in isolation of other social and environmental pressures. Local climate change pressures need to reflect this holistic perspective, and focus largely on understanding the interactions and cumulative effects of climate change and a host of other factors such as resource development, rapid social change, population growth, health decline, educational achievement, long range contaminant transport, and other factors.\n\nClearly there is a growing need for the practical application of research on the uncertainty, challenges, and impacts of climate change on Arctic communities. However, in the Arctic there is a large gap between scientific research and building capacity for sustainable development.\n\nThis research will contribute practical results to climate change impact and adaptation research, provide examples of mitigation and contribute to the improving the health and well-being of Arctic communities. Areas of focus will be on housing design, building technology, alternative energy, community planning, waste management and capacity building. The current housing situation in many Arctic communities is one of severe overcrowding and complete reliance on diesel fuel for energy needs. This situation is leading to negative mental and physical health problems to individuals and leaving communities vulnerable to rising fuel prices. \n\nResearch under this activity cluster will take a much needed holistic approach to creating more environmentally friendly, affordable and culturally responsible housing options that positively contribute to the health and well-being of northern-based communities. Increased Arctic planning capacity will be needed in order to maintain community resiliency. This will require the integration of traditional knowledge and scientific research and involve Inuit, First Nation/Aboriginal groups, northerners, community planners, and scientists in different regions of the Arctic.\n\nCollaboration will involve Arctic and national governments, northern and southern-based organizations, and Arctic communities.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that break-up dates, in particular, have been occurring earlier in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere over the last 50 years in response to warmer climatic conditions in the winter and spring seasons. Break-up dates, and to a lesser extent freeze-up dates, have been shown to be strongly related to the variability and trends in the 0oC isotherm dates as well as large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns (teleconnections), particularly in western North America. The impacts of recently documented trends in air temperature and winter precipitation over the last five decades and those projected by global climate models could be significant on the timing and duration of ice cover (and on ice thickness) on Arctic lakes. This could, in turn, have an important feedback effect on energy, water, and biogeochemical cycling in various regions of the Arctic. How ice phenology (i.e. freeze-up/break-up dates, ice cover duration) and ice thickness have changed over the last five decades, and what will likely be the impacts of projected 21st century climate warming on ice cover for lakes of various depths in different regions of the pan-Artic domain are questions that must be examined in order to gain a deeper understanding of climate-lake interactions in the Arctic. The proposed research project will seek to answer these pressing questions. The overall goal will be to provide a pan-Arctic view of the temporal and spatial variability and trends in lake ice cover in relation to teleconnection patterns during the second half of the 20th century, and plausible scenarios of the response of lake ice cover to projected future climate.\n\nThe analyses from this research will provide a better understanding of the impacts of the large-scale atmospheric and oceanic oscillations on past lake-ice conditions. This, along with modelled projections of future climate, will offer insight into future regional changes to lake-ice characteristics and resultant hydrologic and ecologic impacts over various regions of the Arctic. The goal of the proposed project reflects very well the goals and objectives of the US-lead initiative Study on Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) in detecting and elucidating the recent changes in the Arctic and their impacts on human lives and activities. It is also directly related to the overarching goal of the pan-Arctic Community-wide Hydrological Analysis and Monitoring Program (Arctic-CHAMP) which seeks to better understand and predict the arctic hydrologic cycle. More specifically, the proposed research will provide observations and modeling results which will help fill current gaps in understanding the pan-Arctic hydrological cycle. This project is of direct relevance to three of the five main scientific themes of IPY: 1) to determine the present environmental status of polar regions by quantifying their spatial and temporal variability; 2) to quantify, and understand, past and present environmental and human change in polar regions in order to improve predictions; and 3) to advance our understanding of polar – global teleconnections on all scales, and of the processes controlling these interactions. Results of this project will contribute valuable information to other IPY projects, most notably “The State and Fate of the Cryosphere”, as well as international climate change programs (e.g. Climate and Cryosphere (CliC), Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), Integrated Global Observing System (IGOS) – Cryosphere) and assessments such as the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Ultimately, this project will not only deliver a pan-Arctic view of the response of lake ice to past and future climate conditions, but will also highlight the impacts of ice cover changes on regional climate, hydrology, lake ecology, and Arctic communities.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=423",

Minorities\nand the poor are known to be adversely affected by\nunregulated growth, ineffective regulation of industrial\nand hazardous waste facilities, and local land use policies\nthat favor those communities with political and economic\nclout (Bullard, 1994a). Environmental justice, defined as\nthe provision of fair, equitable treatment of people of all\nraces, cultures and income with respect to the development,\nimplementation and enforcement of laws, regulations and\npolicies, has become an issue of top priority in the United\nStates. However, despite the strong regional and national\ninterest in environmental justice, our ability to determine\nthe disproportionate distribution of environmental risks\nwithin minority and low-income populations is still lacking.\nIn general terms, it is well understood that racial minorities\nand the poor shoulder a disproportionate share of environmental\nhazards, but the computer-based tools needed to effectively\nredress existing and future environmental justice concerns\nare yet to be developed, especially for Iowa. In order to\nachieve a full understanding of the process and casual\nmechanisms of involved in environmental justice, an\nintegrated and spatially explicit modeling approach is needed.\n\nProject Goal:\n\nThe work proposed here will develop a GIS-based tool\nand prototype system that will allow us to investigate\nissues of environmental justice involving hazardous waste\nfacilities, underground storage tanks, and large hog farms\nin Iowa. The study will integrate a wide range of existing\nenvironmental, socioeconomic, and demographic databases with\nArcView GIS and S-Plus statistical analysis software to test\nthe overarching hypothesis that higher levels of environmental\ndegradation in Iowa are associated with race, ethnicity and\nincome. A detailed geographic analysis will be conducted to\nweigh the relative strength of the association of race and\nincome with the distribution of environmental hazards\nidentified above. The target audiences for the study are\nenvironmental citizen groups, state resource agencies,\nracial minority groups, and federal government agencies\ncharged with environmental and public health mission.\n\nThis study will address three environmental statutes:\nthe Safe Drinking Water Act, through analysis of large\nhog farms and waste lagoons; Toxic Substances Control\nAct, through analysis of hazardous waste facilities in\nthe EPA?s Toxic Release Inventory; and the Comprehensive\nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act\n(through analysis of underground storage tanks).\nFurthermore, since the study will use a GIS-based\napproach to enhance understanding of environmental\ninequity problems and will involve workshops and\ninformation exchange, it meets the first and third\nprogram goals identified in the Office of Environmental\nJustice Small Grant Program.\n\nThis study has the potential to make significant\nfundamental contributions to our understanding of\nenvironmental justice concerns in Iowa and to provide\nthe basis for targeting and/or prioritizing enforcement,\npollution prevention, education, and outreach programs\nrequired in the implementation of environmental justice.\nAlso the project will provide the tool needed by resource\nagencies to develop comprehensive regional and statewide\nstrategy for responding to environmental justice concerns.\n\n\nProject Contact:\n\nU.

On geological time-scales, these water mass exchanges are controlled by the deepening and shallowing of areas of ocean floor during the tectonic opening and closing of strategic oceanic gateways and the formation of ocean basins. Establishing the detailed tectonic, geodynamic, sedimentary and paleo-topographic histories of strategic oceanic basins and gateways will provide the essential framework for modelling studies that will relate these events to paleo-climate observations collected across the globe.\n                 \nPLATES & GATES adopts a multidisciplinary approach by addressing tectono-magmatic, geodynamic, sedimentary and biostratigraphic processes, utilising paleo-biological and geochemical proxies, past and recent oceanographic conditions in the gateways, as well as by using state-of-the-art geophysical techniques, sediment coring, ocean drilling and accompanying land investigations.\n\nThe main objectives include:\n(1) studies of the crust/lithosphere of the polar ocean basins and polar gateways as well as their continental margins to develop a good understanding of the past and present plate kinematics, mantle processes, margin formations, and crustal subsidence and uplift processes, \n(2) understanding the past ocean current systems in the basins and gateways by examining the record of change preserved in deep-ocean sediment deposits and drifts, and by undertaking seismic-stratigraphic investigations and analyses of present and paleo-oceanographic proxies to derive the evolution of deep-water circulation and climate change, \n(3) reconstructing detailed ocean basin and gateway opening processes and constraining the timing of shallow and deep water mass exchange between basins, \n(4) understanding the long-term paleo-climatic history from Mesozoic-Early Tertiary Greenhouse conditions to upper Tertiary-Quaternary Icehouse conditions, and \n(5) identifying and modelling the role of gateway openings/closures in the global carbon cycle, bio-evolution and the development of ice-sheets and climatic changes. \n\nPaleomagnetic, stratigraphic and petrological data from Franz Josef Land, Axel Heiberg I., Ellesmere I., the New Siberian Is. and North Greenland will be collected and analysed. Geoscientific studies including bathymetric mapping, seismic and magnetic surveying, sub-bottom profiling and sediment coring will be carried out in the Amundsen Basin, on transects across the Alpha-Mendeleev Ridge, over the Lomonosov Ridge and from the North Greenland Shelf. Geological and neotectonic studies are planned for North and East Greenland, Svalbard, Bear Island, Mohns Ridge, Knipovich Ridge and the Barents Sea. The gateways between the North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean will be investigated by a wide spectrum of geophysical and geological approaches to understand the timing and paleo-climatic consequences of water mass exchange. The Bering Strait, as the only freshwater connection between the Arctic and the Pacific, will be investigated by geophysical surveying and geological sampling (drilling). Geophysical and bathymetric surveying as well as geological and biological sampling is planned for critical regions of the Southern Ocean that formed since the break-up of Gondwana. A thorough revision of this break-up will be performed in parallel with new data acquisition giving special emphasis to the compilation and integration of existing data sets. Uncertainties about the early stages of development of the Drake Passage/Scotia Sea gateway will be resolved by studies of the tectonic and sedimentary evolution of the basins and the origin of bathymetric highs, the structure and history of relevant plate boundaries, and deformation of neighbouring land areas. Geophysical data will be collected in the Tasmanian Gateway to constrain the timing of shallow and deep-water opening between the Indian and Pacific Oceans as well as the motion between East and West Antarctica which is critical to the timing of the uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains. Other regions of interest include the passage between the southern Kerguelen Plateau and Antarctic continent as well as major topographically outstanding transform and fracture zone systems in the Pacific. \n\nPLATES & GATES will perform Cenozoic and Mesozoic climate reconstructions using a variety of Earth system models designed to evaluate the effect of ocean gateways and basins on paleo-circulation patterns, the global carbon cycle and nature of polar ice-sheet development. These experiments will include sensitivity runs incorporating new paleo-bathymetric reconstructions arising from the new data acquisition described above. The results from these experiments will be compared with other model simulations, which include different forcing factors such as atmospheric greenhouse gasses and mountain uplift to determine the relative importance of paleo-geography on the evolution of polar and global climates over long geological timescales.",

The transect from Prydz Bay-Amery Ice Shelf-Lambert Glacier Basin-Dome A is an interconnected ocean, ice-shelf and ice sheet system, which plays a very important role in east Antarctica mass balance, sea level and climate change. Dome A is a little known region of the Antarctic and, as it is the highest part of Antarctic ice sheet, it is an ideal place for observing the earths environmental background and making new scientific findings in a range of disciplines\n The ice thickness at the summit of Dome A was measured as over 3000 m by the 21st Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition (CHINARE-21) in the austral summer of 2004/2005. Snow accumulation occurs mostly by diamond dust sublimation directly from the troposphere and the oldest ice in Antarctica may be found there. It is hence a potential site to reconstruct a 1.2M year recordof the past climate and environment.\n With the extremely cold, dry and stable air found at the summit of Dome A, the area provides the best site on the Earths surface for the conduct of a wide range of astronomical observations, from optical to millimetre wavelengths.\n Beneath the ice at Dome A and near the centre of the Antarctic Continent lie the unexplored Gamburtsev sub-glacial mountains. Study of these may contribute greatly to theoretical earth science and to understanding the geological history of Antarctica.\n Observations along the Zhongshan-Dome A are important for studying ice dynamic processes and mass balance, recent climate history and SolarWind/Magnetosphere/Ionosphere coupling.\n The ocean circulation in Prydz Bay is one of the major gyres around the Antarctic and it both affects and is affected by interaction beneath the Amery Ice Shelf. Improved oceanographic studies are required of the Prydz Bay circulation, its role in Southern Ocean circulation, and the potential impacts of change on both physical and biological systems.\nWhat we will do for PANDA?\nPANDA presents a integrated view of the Prydz Bay-Amery-Lambert glacier basin-Dome A system, with Chinese scientific and logistical leadership, partnership, coordination and cooperation for many international IPY efforts focused on this region and on Antarctica. Specifically, Chinese leadership and partnership as part of PANDA will support IPY through the following objectives:\n\n- To construct a scientific research station at the summit of Dome A supporting future scientific programs in this region nationally and internationally.\n- To establish a long-term observing/monitoring system for climate change research along the Prydz Bay, Amery Ice Shelf, Lambert glacier basin and Dome A transect, a data sparse region of Antarctica. This will involve partnerships with other meteorological, glaciological and oceanographic projects during IPY.\n- To improve understanding on variability and physical processes of the ocean and sea ice in the Prydz Bay region, and on their response and feedback to climate change. This will involve partnership with the IPY SASSI programme.\n- To understand processes of interaction between ocean and ice shelf and their effect on the stability of the ice shelf and ice sheet.\n- To obtain a series of shallow ice cores between Zhongshan and Dome A for investigation of recent climate variability and change, and a medium depth ice core at Dome A.\n- To determine site characteristics for deep ice core drilling at Dome A to potentially re-construct a 1.2M year climate record. This assessment during IPY will lead to new efforts to start deep ice core drilling in the summer of 2009/2010.\n-To assess site characteristics at Dome A for astronomical observations.\n-To find a suitable site for sub-glacial geological drilling in the Gamburtsev Mountains area.\n-To establish a chain of magnetometers between Zhongshan and Dome A for studying the dynamics of the solar wind-magnetospheric-ionospheric coupling. This will include comprehensive upper atmosphere observations at Zhongshan Station and will involve cooperation with the IPY solar-earth coupling and magnetosphere dynamics programmes.\n\nMany of these activities will leave a legacy of an infrastructure capability for international research after IPY.\nPlanned field activities during 2007-2010:\n1. Prydz Bay and Amery Ice Shelf\n-During austral summers of 2005/2006, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009: oceanographic and ice shelf surveys in Prydz Bay and Amery Ice Shenlf.\n-2007/2008: deploy hydrographic instruments into the cavity beneath the Amery Ice Shelf in collaboration with an Australian hot water drilling project. Obtain 2 years continuous measurements from the instruments.\n2. Zhongshan-Dome A traverse and activities at the summit of Dome A:\n2007/2008 season:\n- Glaciological observations along Zhongshan-Dome A transect.\n- To carry out glaciological observations and recover a 350-500m ice core at the summit of Dome A.\n- Undertake an ice radar survey in the Gamburtsev sub glacial area to search the suitable site for a geological drilling.\n- Determine a deep ice core drilling site, and transport a deep ice core drill to the summit of Dome A from Dome F.\n- To set up a 100 m2 building at Dome A.\n- To install several instruments for assessing astronomical conditions at Dome A\n- Install 4 low power magnetometers along the track.\n- Establish fuel depots at Dome A and at a site 800km south of Zhongshan Station.\n2008/2009 season:\n- To complete Dome A Station with a building area of 250 m2 and facilities for 10 winterers.\n- To make a pilot hole for deep ice core drilling and set up deep ice core drilling system.\n- Undertake further glaciological observations of the area.\n- Other observations.\n2009/2010 season:\n- To operate the Dome A station and start deep ice core drilling there.\n- Other observation including astronomy observations, etc.\n\nPrevious work at Zhongshan-Dome A, Amery Ice Shelf and Prydz Bay by CHINARE\nDuring the last decade CHINARE has carried out following research work:\n-Four inland traverses from the Zhongshan Station towards Dome A have been made in the summers of 1996/1997, 1997/1998,1998/1999 and 2004/2005. Glaciological observations were obtained and samples were obtained from shallow cores and snow pits along the route. During the latest traverse, the CHINARE team reached the summit of the Dome by snow mobiles. A series of measurements in glaciology and meteorology were carried out, and two automatic weather stations were installed in collaboration with Australia, one is at the summit of the Dome and one at the mid-point of the transect.\n-Glaciological field programs have been conducted on the Amery Ice Shelf in the summers of 2002/2003, 2003/2004, 2004/2005. The major work has included ice radar surveys of ice thickness, GPS measurements of ice velocity, estimation of ice shelf mass balance, recovery of a 296m ice core, and hydrographic observations along the edge of the Amery Ice Shelf.\n-Physical oceanography, chemical oceanography, marine biology and geochemistry observations in the Prydz Bay region, have been carried out since 1989. A series of data have been obtained.\n-Ground-based observations of the ionosphere (imaging riometer), optical aurora, geomagnetic fields, etc. have been carried out at Zhongshan Station for more than ten years.",

With modern technology, incorporating advances in communications and computers, these barriers can be overcome resulting in a transforming impact in polar communities. As a global leader in online distance education (e-learning), Athabasca University Canada's Open University (AU) with its partners in the University of the Arctic and allied institutions in other countries, is the natural choice to implement viable learning programs. For example, AU's exemplary programs in Health sciences, nursing, education, policing, computer and information systems, and management, address subject areas in which there is a critical lack of skilled personnel in the North, and in particular among the indigenous communities. By combining this internationally recognized educational leadership in e-learning, which is eminently appropriate for reaching the North, with the exploration of new and appropriate technologies including satellite and mobile media, many of the major obstacles to learning in the Arctic can be overcome.\n\nGrowing from AU's experience working with information and communication technologies for learning and from its international partnerships, the participants in this project propose to develop an advanced learning network using Internet via satellite access technologies to reach remote communities and wireless devices for dissemination and communications within the communities. This high tech delivery will be used to support a learning-centred methodological approach to learning, teaching, and community development. This will promote an online learning culture in rural communities improving digital literacy, access to local and external educational resources, promoting lifelong community-centred learning and collaboration, while reducing technology resistance in dozens of pilot sites in up to eight Arctic countries using the partnerships developed through AU's membership in the University of the Arctic. The ultimate goals are growth, and the transfer of knowledge at various levels, in a range of relevant subject areas, starting with a specific, particularly appropriate module in e-portfolio development for prior learning assessment and recognition (PLAR) and a first year university course in polar astronomy/space science, taking advantage of the internet accessible astronomical observatory at Athabasca University. A range of full programmes for polar students is envisioned. This POLAR WMT learning network can also be accessed by other scientists for the training of high quality personnel using high speed electronic media to deliver courses and conduct lessons, workshops, seminars, and lectures. A principal aim of this project is to support the creation of a new culture in rural communities promoting digital literacy and reducing resistance to the use of new technologies. It will go a step further, encouraging user to add their significant contribution to the emerging applications by involving them in meaningful activities, tailored to address the needs of different user groups. Thus, this project aims to offer stimulating and creative learning environments to support vibrant user communities and will attempt an extended implementation in dozens of pilot sites in the Arctic \n\nThis project will be based on innovative 'action' and 'design-based' research methodologies and practices aimed at experimenting with and developing real world implementations of new learning experiences for remote learners using the latest technologies. The objective is to facilitate learning in homes, schools, the workplace, community centres, adult education forums, and a variety of informal contexts using wireless and mobile devices. Serving the special needs of learners in the Arctic requires a better understanding of the geographical, cultural and evolving technological environment in which they live.\n\nThe project will mobilize community support by involving stake holders (community leaders, government officials, local teachers) in the creation of a plan for the sustainability and development of the learning system exploring new technologies as they arise and their applicability for learning. This will involve (1) determining how the satellite/wireless platform will need to evolve in order to meet increasing user expectations (2) comparing this with current developments that are under way with the ICT hardware and software development companies (3) developing innovative ways of implementing the satellite/wireless infrastructure, demonstrating the enhanced potential of communication via satellite to the users in the Arctic region (4) selecting the most appropriate applications, and proposing a roadmap for replication, including both technical and pedagogical demonstrations promoting the use of satellite/wireless learning widely throughout the Arctic.",

The experiment\nfocused on the southern shelf of the Weddell Sea.\n\nThe ship departed from the Falkland Islands on January 14 and returned\non February 20, operating in the southern Weddell Sea for the period\nJanuary 21 to February 12. Over one hundred\nconductivity-temperature-depth ('CTD') stations were collected in the\nregion of the Filchner overflow, and near and north of the Ronne ice\nfront. Bathymetry data were obtained over the southwestern continental\nshelf, a region for which no prior data existed. Five European current\nmeter moorings were recovered, three from the Ronne ice front and two\nfrom the Filchner Depression. Four new European/US moorings were\ndeployed in a region where dense water modified by the inclusion of\npotentially supercooled Ice Shelf Water first flows down the\ncontinental slope after leaving the Filchner Depression.\n\nThe primary goal of the program was to obtain oceanographic, sea-ice,\nand atmospheric measurements to improve our understanding of the\nphysical processes coupling the southern Weddell Sea to the\ncirculation and properties of the global ocean and atmosphere. In the\nsouthern Weddell Sea, four elements strongly interact with each other:\nthe ocean over the continental shelf; the polar atmosphere; sea-ice\n(when it is present); and the massive floating glacial ice shelves,\nwhich are the oceanic termination of continental ice as it flows off\nthe Antarctic continent.\n\nTherefore, the primary research tasks for the cruise were:\n  - Atmospheric measurements over sea ice and boundary layer\ndevelopment near ice shelves;\n  - Sea ice observations and sampling;\n  - Conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) ocean profiling;\n  - Oceanographic mooring deployment and recovery; and\nBathymetry.\n\nSea ice conditions during the cruise were very favourable, allowing\nthe ship to survey a large area north of the Ronne Ice Front.  No\nprevious oceanographic or even bathymetric data have been obtained\nfrom this region.\n\nOur data will be integrated with other programs in the region,\nincluding measurements obtained under the Ronne Ice Shelf (Nicholls,\n1996). This study will improve our ability to model the Weddell Sea's\nrole in such processes as the global fresh water budget and the\ngeneration of Antarctic Bottom Water, the latter being a fundamental\ncomponent of the Global Ocean Conveyor Belt (Broecker, 1991).\n\nThe primary institution responsible for the ROPEX cruise is the\nBritish Antarctic Survey (BAS). Other participating institutions are:\n\n  - Southampton Oceanography Center (Southampton, UK);\n  - Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (Liverpool, UK);\n  - Alfred-Wegener Institute (Bremerhaven, Germany);\n  - Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (Hanover, New\nHampshire);\n  - Los Alamos National Laboratory (Los Alamos, New Mexico); and\n  - Earth & Space Research (Seattle, Washington).\n\nThe US component of this research was supported by the National\nScience Foundation grant OPP-9615525.",

Assessing the processes of oceanic and atmospheric forcing on this ice cover is critically important in understanding the response of the Arctic marine ecosystem to climate variability and change. Security of food sources is a key element in this change as is the stability of traditional lifestyles, sustainable exploitation of new resources and education of the next generation of Arctic Scientists. The present variability in sea ice cover on Arctic marine ecosystems and regional climate requires a substantial improvement in our understanding of the links between freshwater and sea ice, sea ice and climate, and sea ice and biogeochemical fluxes. The need for data is particularly strong for the shallow coastal shelf regions (30% of the Arctic basin), the shelf-basin interface and within the marginal ice zones and polynyas of the Arctic.The environmental, socio-economic and geopolitical consequences of an eventual sustained reduction of Arctic sea ice are bound to be tremendous: marine Arctic ecosystems will be displaced, a new ocean will open to exploitation, climate warming may accelerate, global ocean circulation may be modified, and traditional use will change. Given our Arctic responsibilities the PAN-AME cluster is an essential element in the international efforts to understand the current a near future changes on the physical-biological coupling within the Arctic marine ecosystem.\n\nScience \n\nThe PANA-AME cluster will focus on testable hypotheses integrated across several research projects in a coordinate effort to examine the role of that changing oceanic and atmospheric forcing have over the Arctic marine ecosystem. Space limits the presentation of these but we illustrate with these core questions to be addressed: What is the role of hydrologic, oceanographic and meteorological processes in ice growth, decay and transport in each of the cluster regions of interest (ROI) and what is the large scale context within which they are embedded? What are the hydrodynamic (including ice and snow cover dynamics) control of Arctic shelf photosynthetic production and its export to the benthos and the pelagic food web. What is the flux of carbon associated with these processes and how does this change in our various ROI? What is the potential impact of increased UV radiation on biological productivity? What is the role of microheterotrophs and mesozooplankton in transforming autochthonous and allochthonous particulate and dissolved matter? What are the trophic linagkages in various ROI within our cluster how is energy transfer between trophic levels affected by changes inn the physical system? How are contaminants linked to changes in the physical and biological systems and what is the nature of source, sink and transport these elements? Detailed physical and biological measurements will be used to constrain and calibrate physical models of ocean-sea ice-atmosphere coupling and biophysical models of ecosystem function and carbon flows within the IPY-AME regions of interest. Field work will focus on significant time scales pertinent to each of our ROI with ranges from weekly to interannually. Observatories will be a key element in the cluster with installation within the IPY timeframe and continuation of these observatories as a legacy of the IPY.\n\nBenefits\n \nThis cluster marshals the majority of existing international expertise in Arctic marine ecosystem research. It also marshals involvement of circumarctic aboriginal peoples through involvement in individual ROIs. By clustering we agree to integrate our geographically separate projects into a coordinated pan-Arctic IPY program through standardization of sampling methods, coordination of people, resources, and access to a wealth of existing arctic logistics (field stations, ice camps, ships, aircraft). We agree to archive a coordinated data repository which will remain as a legacy of this project. We also intend to share data amongst science teams working in different ROIs as a means of assessing marine ecosystem response to pan-arctic climate variability and change.",

The aim of the project is to recover a 750 m deep ice core from Roosevelt Island in Antarctica to determine the stability of the Ross Ice Shelf and West Antarctica in a warming world.\n\nThe potential for rapid deglaciation of West Antarctica remains a primary uncertainty in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predictions for 21st Century sea level rise. The recent and unpredicted collapse of multiple ice shelves and rapid acceleration of discharge of Antarctic ice suggests that dynamical responses to warming play a more significant role than is currently understood and captured in coupled climate-ice sheet models. Such models can be improved and validated by replicating known past changes. The RICE Project is an international partnership seeking to understand past, present, and future changes of the Ross Ice Shelf, a major drainage pathway of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The ANDRILL programme showed, that about 5 to 3 million years ago, the last time when atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and temperatures were similar to those predicted for the end of the 21st Century, the Ross Ice Shelf disintegrated multiple times, initiating the collapse of West Antarctica. However, no high resolution data exist from this time period. To determine the rate of change, RICE aims to provide an annually resolved ice core record for the past 20,000 years and beyond, when global temperatures increased by 6 deg C to preindustrial temperatures, global sea level rose by ~120 m, and the Ross Ice Shelf grounding line retreated over 1,000 km. Most of the Ross Ice Shelf retreat occurred when global sea level had already reached modern levels. For this reason, the precise correlation between increasing air and ocean temperatures, and the velocity and characteristics of the ice shelf retreat, provides a unique opportunity to determine accurately the sensitivity of the Ross Ice Shelf to warming.\n\nFor more information, please visit: http://www.victoria.ac.nz/antarctic/research/research-prog/rice",

Biological activity, biomass, production and remineralization in these systems are essentially microbial while higher trophic levels (crustaceans, fish, and mammals) play a minor role in quantitative terms. Microorganisms are the main drivers of biogeochemical cycles and the major producers and consumers of green-house gases, and they are therefore significant players in regulating the ecosphere. In addition, they can be important sentinels of environmental change, as alterations in the structure and biomass of microbial communities can herald changes not only in pathways of nutrient and energy transfer in foodwebs, but also in biogeochemical cycles. Despite their abundance and likely importance in polar ecosystems, very little is known about the composition of polar microbial communities, their interactions and geochemical roles, or their response to environmental changes.\n\nThe PAME program will focus on polar marine microorganisms and their activities; the processes that relate to these organisms and the significance of these organisms and their activity with respect to climate and global environmental change. The projects participating in PAME will target different aspects of microbial ecology in different polar areas. Projects may also encompass studies undertaken in warmer latitudes where these compliment and inform polar research. Field campaigns, logistics and research will be coordinated through PAME, and the projects will share and exchange data, samples, field opportunities, infrastructure, human and intellectual resources in order to obtain better and more complete datasets from field surveys and experimental studies than otherwise would be possible. \nUnderstanding microbial food web structure and function involves major research tasks related to community composition, population dynamics and flux of energy and matter. \n\nPAME will assess microbial biodiversity and community composition employing a full range of approaches from classical taxonomic studies to metagenomics of community DNA. The work will include development and application of state-of-the-art molecular methods to detect, enumerate and monitor sentinel ('indicator') microbial genes, functions and taxa, and to determine the molecular biodiversity of key microbial groups. Population dynamics, trophic interactions and flow of energy and matter between different microbial compartments and biogeochemical pools will be investigated both during field campaigns and in experimental ecosystem models (mesocosms). Experimental approaches to climate and environmental change, as well as mathematical modelling, will be integral parts of this work. The overriding aim is to understand how external and internal driving forces and control mechanisms regulate microbial processes and how they affect community structure and biogeochemical cycles.",

The Atlas is envisioned as significantly contributing to making IPY activities and results accessible to students, teachers, the media, policy makers, scientists, and the general public. The Atlas will enable users to interact with information on a wide range of topics identified as IPY themes including environmental change and human activity in the polar regions. One of the technological contributions of the proposed activity will be an Atlas that enables users to contribute content, thus involving polar community residents in meaningful ways.\n\nBeyond the project focus on Education and Outreach, the project will generate Canadian contributions to an infrastructure that will enable the open, free, and unrestricted access to data and information generated through the IPY programme. The Atlas will be developed on a Spatial Data Infrastructure model and the data management structures being developed by the International community (EoI 409/ proposal 49). A key national element of the SDI development strategy is partnership with Natural Resources Canada, specifically the activities related to EoI 993. The members of The Atlas proposal will take a lead role in the research aspects of the project while members of the EoI 993 proposal will lead with respect to community liaison in the Arctic and infrastructure development.\n\nThe primary project activity is to promote education and outreach by making the findings from IPY accessible to a wide range of participants. An on-line atlas developed on a SDI can provide a valuable mechanism that allows experts and non-experts alike to access information. We are currently developing such an atlas for the Antarctic region through a major collaborative research grant funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada. This atlas is being developed through international partnerships and is entitled the SCAR Cybercartographic Atlas of Antarctica (CAA) (http://www.carleton.ca/gcrc/caap). We have significant expertise and existing infrastructure that will facilitate extending the current Atlas framework to include both polar regions. We have partnered with several Arctic-related projects: 1) Exchange for Local Observations and Knowledge of the Arctic (EoI 358 to be submitted as a full proposal for September 30) and 2) Inuit Sea Ice Use and Occupancy Project (EoI 715, situated within a cluster initiative entitled SIKU (Sea Ice Knowledge and Use in the Arctic) to be submitted as a full proposal for September 30). To ensure that our efforts are integrated with other international efforts, we are collaborating with the Polar Post Project (EoI 469) led by the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in the United States that shares many similar objectives to the proposed Atlas. We have initiated discussions with other Canadian education-related projects such as Mission Antarctique (EoI 465) and will continue to pursue collaborative activities to enrich the proposed Atlas. \n\nThe Atlas development as proposed will require an available network of data such as a SDI or an observatory network as proposed by the eGy (Electronic Geophysical Year). We are actively involved in SDI development for the Antarctic (see section 3.6). The development of the Arctic component of the SDI will be carried out through national (EoI 993) and international partnerships. To ensure that the SDI components for the two Polar Regions are compatible, we will collaborate and coordinate efforts with other geoscientific information management initiatives, including the IPY DIS (Proposal 49) and the related Circumarctic Environmental Observatories Network/ARCUS (Arctic Research Consortium of the United States, EoI 265), the Joint Committee on Antarctic Data Management and the SCAR Experts Group on Geospatial Information.\n\nOur project will span the two-year observation period of IPY (1 March 2007-1 March\n2009) and beyond.",

This\nproject, the Plume Model Validation and Development (PMV&D) project,\ncomprises four studies of plumes in different environmental settings.\nThe initial phase of the PMV&D project examined plume dispersion\nbehavior in relatively uncomplicated terrain.  Field measurement\nprograms were conducted in the vicinity of the Kincaid Generating\nStation in central Illinois, which is located in smooth, level\nterrain.  The measurement programs included nine months of continuous\nmonitoring of air quality, meteorological, and power plant emission\nvariables, supplemented by three three-week periods of intensive,\nspecialized measurements of plume dispersion.\nThe second phase of the PMV&D project investigated plume behavior in\nmoderately complex terrain.  Field measurement programs were carried\nout in the vicinity of the Bull Run steam plant, situated 20 km west\nof Knoxville and 8 km east of Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  The field\nprograms at this site included two four-week periods of intensive,\nspecialized measurements of plume dispersion.\nThe behavior of plumes in complex terrain was studied during a third\nphase in a joint effort with EPA at the Sierra Pacific Power Company's\nTracy plant, 20 km east of Reno, Nevada along the Truckee River.  A\npreliminary experiment was conducted at the site over a four-week\nperiod, including two weeks of intensive measurements of plume\nbehavior.  This study laid the groundwork for the design of EPA's Full\nScale Plume Study (FSPS) at that site.  EPRI supported both programs\nby supplying airborne lidar sampling of the power plant plume.\nFinally, the fourth phase of the PMV&D Project was a study conducted\nat the Perry-K Steam Station of Indianapolis (Indiana) Power and Light\nCompany to investigate plume behavior in an urban environment.  The\nplant is located about 1 km from the urban center of Indianapolis.\nThe field program included four weeks of intensive measurements of\nplume dispersion and an additional week for a collocation experiment.\nSee: 'http://src.com/~epriasdc/pmv/pmv.htm' for information on\nPMV.",

IPY is an unprecedented opportunity that places polar residents right at the centre of this huge, international, global programme. The development of Polar Gateways provides an opportunity for these communities to get involved in IPY, to share their voice and concerns with the rest of the world, to unite neighbours who live at opposite ends of the world, to support the IPY community, and to reach a wide audience of tourists, media, educators, artists, and decision makers.\n\nPolar Gateways proposes to establish centres at key access points to the Arctic and Antarctic. The initial proposal includes one centre in Ushuaia, Argentina, and one in Longyearbyen, Svalbard. Both of these locations are home to active communities who are excited about IPY and keen to get further involved. After establishing these centres, the hope is to extend the invitation to create similar initiatives within any interested polar gateway community, North and South. The result will therefore not only be a huge education and outreach programme for IPY, but will also connect polar communities around the world who share many concerns related to physical isolation and an immediate concern for the changing environment.\n\nPolar Gateways will fulfil a range of functions, dependent on location. These may include:\n\n-Present the IPY programme and contents in the form of displays and material\n-Provide local support and a friendly face to the IPY community in the field\n-Build a network of polar communities \n-Provide a natural link between IPY field activities and local initiatives\n-Provide a focal point about IPY to media and tourists\n-Provide a local space for interviews, meetings, education, information\n-Support local capacity building\n-Connect science and scientists to education and outreach programmes globally\n-Educate about both poles from one location\n-Be an outlet for IPY merchandise, leaflets, posters, cards, dvds, etc..\n-Inform about the scientific content of IPY\n-Contribute to the IPY.org web-log with local IPY stories and experiences\n-Provide a contact point locally for IPY queries during the relevant field seasons\n-Allow contact for the international media with IPY: icebergs, scientists and all!\n-Build up an international database of close to the poles visitors-Connect Polar Gateways to each other, and activities in the Arctic and Antarctic, via web-cams and other technology \n\nLocations for the centres have already been suggested in both Ushuaia and Lonyearbyen, as well as strong community support. This is critical for the success of such a programme. It is envisaged that the Ushuaia Centre would open in time for the 2006-7 summer season and the Longyearbyen centre would be open in time for the 2007 season, thus catching the full length of IPY.",

Satellite monitoring is a powerful tool for polar monitoring. It is the only operational method to provide information over large and often inaccessible areas in a cost-effective manner. EO-derived information can support monitoring and analysis related to sustainable development (e.g. transportation, resource exploration, site remediation, bio-productivity monitoring), the environment (e.g. climate change, pollution, animal populations and habitats), and public safety (e.g. activity monitoring, disaster management, search and rescue). \n\nIt is planned to provide expert control of the remotely sensed information collaboratively with responsible ice services on the basis of routine ice charts, in particular for areas experiencing higher probability for ambiguous interpretation, such as Antarctica, areas during melt season and the fast ice zone.\n\nFunded under the European Space Agency (ESA)/European Commission Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) initiative, Polar View brings together service providers, researchers and most of the world's national ice services to provide operational information services related to polar environments to international, national and local stakeholders worldwide. Polar View maintains close links with the JCOMM Expert Team on Sea Ice, the International Ice Charting Working Group, and the European and Canadian Space Agencies to support its operations.\n\nA dedicated web portal will be developed to deliver Polar View IPY ice information. It will include a standard suite of products consisting of ice information routinely produced by the national ice services and Polar View for both logistics (e.g. sea ice distribution information for shipping) and science (e.g. development and detailed spatio-temporal distribution of ice leads). In addition, the specialized, custom-tailored products will be offered in support of specific IPY activities. The products will be generated primarily, but not exclusively, using EO data. The portal will be a convenient, single (although not the only) access point for ice-related information.\n\nPolar View will contribute its existing mechanisms to minimize EO data acquisition conflicts and coordinate with EO data providers. Access to the information on the Polar View portal will be open to all IPY researchers.",

The scale of International Polar Year and the mass media attention that it will generate make this a perfect time to attract the general public to polar research. While many people are interested in the North, and aware of Northern issues in so much as they are presented in newspapers and on the evening news, such interested non-specialists do not have an obvious place to turn to get more detailed, in-depth information about Northern research. Our goal is to provide these people with a place to go for solid, complex information presented in an easy-to-read, accessible manner.\n\nThe Arctic Institute of North America, which houses the journal _Arctic_, is an ideal place to undertake this project. _Arctic_ is a leading multidisciplinary scholarly journal focusing on the North, which publishes quarterly for a largely academic audience. Many of its articles about science and culture in the North would have wide interest for a public audience, but the language and format in which they are presented is not designed for a non-academic audience. Similarly, the scientific papers in _Polar Research_ and the social sciences and humanites topics explored in _Etudes/Inuit/Studies_ have clear relevance for a larger audience base in both the North and the South. We believe that making the synopses of academic articles more user-friendly will inspire interested readers to pursue further knowledge about the North.\n\nEach quarter, we will select two to three articles from _Arctic_, _Polar Research_, and _Etudes/Inuit/Studies_ for 'popularization' and provide these synopses on the AINA website. By mounting these synopses on the Web and making them freely accessible, we are furthering that endeavour and significantly broadening our reach beyond that of a traditional subscriber-based print journal. We expect this site to become a one-stop portal for Northerners, media, and interested readers in the South.\n\nA key aspect of the project will be to partner with other Canadian and international journals with a Northern focus to expand the service to a wider range of articles that are potentially of public interest. We have, for instance, contacted the editors of _Polar Record_ and _Northern Review_ to invite them to join us in this new project, and are awaiting their responses.\n\nThe project will also partner with Native organizations such as the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami to identify priority topics of interest to Northerners and assist with translation services in the appropriate language for each region covered by a given article. Ultimately, we would like to see links from Northern community groups' own websites to the AINA website to broaden interest and access to the article synopses.",

The processes that control the magnitude of primary production in this region are not well understood, but data suggest that iron limitation is a factor. Field observations and model simulations indicate four potential sources of dissolved iron to surface waters of the Ross Sea:\n\n    circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) intruding from the shelf edge;\n    sediments on shallow banks and nearshore areas;\n    melting sea ice around the perimeter of the polynya;\n    glacial meltwater from the Ross Ice Shelf.\n\nThe principal investigators hypothesize that hydrodynamic transport via mesoscale currents, fronts, and eddies facilitate the supply of dissolved iron from these four sources to the surface waters of the Ross Sea polynya. These hypotheses will be tested through a combination of in situ observations and numerical modeling, complemented by satellite remote sensing. In situ observations will be obtained during a month-long cruise in the austral summer. The field data will be incorporated into model simulations, which allow quantification of the relative contributions of the various hypothesized iron supply mechanisms, and assessment of their impact on primary production. The research will provide new insights and a mechanistic understanding of the complex oceanographic phenomena that regulate iron supply, primary production, and biogeochemical cycling. The research will thus form the basis for predictions about how this system may change in a warming climate.",

This zone, the tundra-taiga ecotone \nvaries dramatically in width (up to hundreds of kilometres) throughout the circum-arctic North and has thus a recognized exceptional\nimportance, in terms of global vegetation, climate, biodiversity and human settlement. Further, the particular vulnerability of \nthe zone to changes in climate and land use is recognized, along with concern for subsequent alterations and shifts of its position\nwith consequences for the entire arctic region through feedback mechanisms. Despite this recognition, comprehensive and large \nscale multidisciplinary scientific focus incorporating cause, effect, and importance of its past and present transformation to \nthe biota and human societies, has been lacking. The PPS Arctic is composed of four scientific modules (cf. 3.2). The unifying \nfoci among the modules are defined by: SPACE The transitional zone between the boreal forest and the open treeless tundra; TIME \nThe Holocene, the present and the next 100 years; SCOPE Interdisciplinary research, monitoring change, and sustainable resource use. \nThe main aim is to obtain an understanding of: i) The controls on the location and pattern of the zone; ii) The effect of global \nchange on the location of the zone; iii) The feedback effect of the character and location of the zone on the global climate. \nImplicit in these three items is consideration of the role of human societies inside and near the transition zone. This refers \nboth to the responses of human communities to changes in the zone and to their impact on the ecotone. The PPS Arctic cluster \nprovides a framework for a coordinated and integrated scientific effort to understand the dynamics of the arctic-boreal transition \nzone, and ensures that results can be used in multiple contexts including informed decision making by the public and policy makers. \nSpecific objectives are: To develop effective techniques and carry out quantitative spatial and temporal analysis of the location \nof transitional ecosystems within the circumpolar arctic-boreal transition zone; To understand ecosystem and geosystem controls \nand responses in different compartments of the zone, both resilient and sensitive; To build realistic models of transition zone \ndynamics; To validate the models by ground level observations, dependent on scale and land use history; To use them to implement \na program of ecosystem, geosystem, and landscape analysis, examining the effects of global and local change on species, communities, \nand ecosystems; To assess the socio-economic impacts of potential future changes in the transitional zones, incorporating results \ninto an expert information system, which will be utilized for estimating climate change responses, sustainable ecosystem management \nand landscape planning in support of policy decisions; To exchange methods on climate change monitoring, sustainable land use \nstrategy and science/policy issues, and use them as a tool in forecasting ecosystem changes and options for mitigation. \nTo realize the main aim and specific objectives PPS Arctic focuses on a set of unifying themes: terminology, location, history \nof shifts, interface processes, model realism, effects of shifts, detecting shifts, and human societies and shifts. A range of \ntasks will be pursued, linked to these themes: Standardize terminology; Determine current location and characteristics using \nremote sensing data, aerial photographs, geographical information systems and field campaigns, as well as using local and indigenous \nknowledge; Study the history of tree distribution patterns more comprehensively using multiple techniques such as tree-ring analysis, \nmacrofossil, stomata and pollen analyses coupled with molecular genetics; Study environmental conditions across the zone by using, \nfor example, meteorological, geomorphological, hydrological, and permafrost measurements; Study population dynamics, population ecology, \ndevelopmental phenology, and physiological ecology of present tundra-taiga species; Study the effect of tree cover on ecosystem ecology \nincluding greenhouse gas fluxes and energy balance across the boreal-arctic interface (feedback effects); Study the nature and effect \nof present and past disturbances such as fires, insect outbreaks and human activities on the nature and location of the zone and its \nsustainable use; Study socio-economic and ecosystem management conditions across the zone, which includes assessment of human impacts \non the nature and location of the zone and consequences for human activities and strategies for sustainable development; Build-process \nbased models and predictions for the effects of environmental change, with a greater degree of realism than current models; Conduct \nscientific manipulation experiments and analyze data from large-scale human activities such as engineering and forestry projects to \ntest the models.",

By the early Triassic, warmer, drier conditions inhibited prolific plant growth. A moister, but still warm climate allowed plants to flourish later in the Triassic.\n\nWe will test and refine this model and investigate the effects of climate change on Permian to Triassic landscapes and ecosystems. Using exposures in the Allan Hills, we will search for, describe, and interpret fossil forests, vertebrate tracks and burrows, arthropod trackways, and subaqueously produced biogenic structures, and document the end of glaciation and the importance of major episodic sedimentation. In so doing, we will address broader questions that will contribute to understanding\n\nthe evolution of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and how they are affected by the end-Permian extinction,\n\nthe abundance and diversity of terrestrial and aquatic arthropods at high latitudes,\n\nthe paleogeographic distribution and evolution of vertebrates and invertebrates as recorded by trace and body fossils, and\n\nthe response of landscapes to changes in climate.\n\nThe excellent record preserved by this Permian to Triassic sequence provides a unique opportunity to compare high-latitude forests and freshwater and terrestrial faunas with better-known low-latitude equivalents during an important period of their evolution.\n\nhttp://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/antarct/treaty/opp06001/geo_geo.jsp#permian",

The location, which was a designated site for the Southern Oxidant Study (SOS), was instrumented for a wide variety of measurements allowing the hydrocarbon and oxy-hydrocarbon measurements to be interpreted both in terms of meteorological data and as part of a large suite of gas phase measurements. Although the site is situated in a Loblolly pine plantation, isoprene was observed to be the dominant hydrocarbon during the daytime with afternoon maxima of about 7 parts per billion by volume (ppbv). Decrease of isoprene after sunset was too rapid to be accounted for solely on the basis of gas phase chemistry. During the nighttime, α-pinene and β-pinene were the dominant hydrocarbons of natural origin. The ratio of α-pinene to β-pinene showed a well-defined diurnal pattern, decreasing by more than 30% during the night; a decrease that could be understood on the basis of local gas phase chemistry. Oxy-hydrocarbons, dominated by methanol and acetone, were the most abundant compounds observed. On a carbon atom basis, the oxy-hydrocarbons contributed about 46% of the measured atmospheric burden during the daytime and about 40% at night. The similarity of the observed diurnal methanol variation to that of isoprene and subsequent measurements [McDonald and Fall, 1993] indicate that much of the observed methanol was of local biogenic origin. Correlation of acetone with methanol suggests that it, also, has a significant biogenic source. In spite of the site's rural location, anthropogenic hydrocarbons constituted, on a carbon atom basis, about 21% of the hydrocarbon burden measured during the daytime and about 55% at night. Significant diurnal variations of the anthropogenic hydrocarbons, with increases at night, appeared to be driven by the frequent formation of a shallow nocturnal boundary layer.\n\nhttp://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1995/95JD02607.shtml",

These data will\nbe of value in climate research and climate change investigations.\n\nThe primary sources of data are the Antarctic research stations and\nautomatic weather stations. Data from mobile platforms, such as ships\nand drifting buoys are not being collected since our goal is to derive\ntime series of data at fixed locations.\n\nSurface and upper air data are being collected and the principal\nstatistics derived are monthly and annual means. Daily data will not\nbe provided in order to keep the data set to a manageable size. With\nthe resources available to the project, it is clearly not possible to\ncollect all the information that could be required by the whole range\nof investigations into change in the Antarctic. Instead a key set of\nmeteorological variables (surface temperature, mean sea level pressure\nand surface wind speed, and upper air temperature, geopotential height\nand wind speed at standard levels) are being assembled and a\ndefinitive set of measurements presented for use by researchers.\n\nA lot of stations have been operated in the Antarctic over the years;\nmany for quite short periods. However, our goal here is to provide\ninformation on the long time series that can provide insight into\nchange in the Antarctic. So to be included, the record from a station\nmust extend for 25 years, although not necessarily in a continuous\nperiod, or be currently in operation and have operated for the last 10\nyears. In READER we have chosen to use only data from year-round\nstations.\n\nIt is important when using mean data to know the number of\nobservations that were used in computing the means. As discussed in\nthe data section, the READER mean monthly values are therefore colour\ncoded to indicate the percentage of possible observations used in\ncomputing each mean.\n\nMetadata are being provided, where possible, to indicate the type of\nobserving systems used to make the measurements, changes of observing\nsite, changes of observing practice etc. The structure of the metadata\nis deliberately flexible and will vary considerable between stations,\ndepending on what information is available.\n\nThe READER data set is being disseminated via CD-ROM and through the\nWorld Wide Web at\nhttp://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/programs-hosted.html. The first\nrelease of the data set covers the period up to the end of 2000 and\ncontains all the data collected so far. However, there are still a\nnumber of significant gaps and it is hoped that these can be filled\nover the coming years. In particular, we still require more upper air\ndata.\n\nThe data set will be kept up to date on a regular basis via the web\nsite and new versions of the CD released periodically.\n\nFor more information on the READER project contact:\n\nJohn Turner\nBritish Antarctic Survey\nHigh Cross\nMadingley Road\nCambridge\nCB3 0ET\nUK\nE-mail: J.Turner&#64bas.ac.uk\nWWW: http://www.nerc-bas.ac.uk/public/icd/jtu/",

Our field campaign provides a thorough examination of the Dry Valley's physical and chemical nature, using an integrated analysis of multiple data sets. Since the Antarctic dry valleys are among the coldest, driest places on Earth, they are an end-member environment that can be used for comparison to less harsh regions on Earth and more extreme environments on other planets. To that end, we leverage the mission return of the currently funded NASA Phoenix Mars mission, which will land between 65-72?N during the International Polar Year, by providing a direct comparison of the two analogous regions. The proposed project also highly complements Phoenix, as it will enhance the validation of two instruments, thereby strengthening the Phoenix data interpretation and perhaps allowing for an increased understanding of the different evolutionary paths of these two planets.\nThe northern polar region of Mars has many similarities to the several analog regions on the Earth, especially the Antarctic Dry Valleys. The Mars polar region is known to have a substantial amount of water-ice within the top meter of the surface (e.g., Boynton et al., 2002) with a dry overburden of a fraction of a meter thick. In addition, the atmospheric water content on Mars is extremely small only 100 pr microns at it's annual peak. Furthermore, it is thought that the north polar regions undergo climatic changes over an obliquity cycle that could melt this ice reservoir (Jakosky et al., 2003), making this region one of the most likely places on Mars to sustain life should it ever have developed. Because of the interest in tracking life forms to the most extreme environments, the knowledge gained from examining atmospheric, chemical, and mineralogical processes in this pristine region of Mars will be highly complementary in understanding similar regions on the Earth.\nTwo of the engineering model instruments that were built to fly aboard the Phoenix spacecraft, the wet chemistry laboratory and the thermal and electrical conductivity probe, will be used in the field in Antarctica. Samples will also be collected and analyzed in Phoenix analog optical and atomic-force microscopy stations, as well as an analog thermal analyzer and gas analysis instrument.\n\nBoynton, W, W.

PROBE experiment at Kavieng, New Guinea (2.5S, 150.8W) in\nJanuary - February, 1993. This afforded an opportunity to use the new\nradiometer alongside the CSIRO Mark II radiometer in a direct\ncomparison. The Division's 0.532 m lidar was also used, and the data\nobtained on cirrus clouds, as well as some altocumulus, will be\nanalyzed with the LIRAD method. The PROBE will also provide excellent\nradiosonde data every six hours, together with continuous microwave\ndata of water vapour column and cloud liquid water column observations\nfrom the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations's (NOAA)\nWave Propagation Laboratory (WPL). The water vapour column data will\nbe invaluable in allowing for any variations in water vapour radiance\nand transmittance at times between radiosonde observations.\n\n        A preliminary analysis of the data indicates the variability\nof the cirrus and its considerable geometrical depth at times and also\nthe persistence of the cirrus cover. Particularly interesting was an\napparent diurnal variation in both the cirrus cover and the optical\ndepth with a maximum at about midday.\n\n        The ARM filter radiometer was run for about 70% of the time on the\n        8.62 m filter; however, for some periods, the radiometer was\n        run with the 10.86 m filter enabling a direct comparison with\n        the Mark II radiometer which used a 10.84 m filter. As the\n        input radiance is chopped against a 40C blackbody, the zero\n        radiance when viewing liquid nitrogen actually gives a large\n        negative signal; whereas, the zero voltage occurs when the\n        input radiance is from a 40C blackbody. The responses of the\n        two radiometers to various clouds are quite evident. The water\n        vapour radiance is large, which is typical for the\n        tropics. Periodically, there are either cirrus radiances or\n        larger cumulus radiances superposed. Also evident is the\n        superior behaviour of the new ARM radiometer. The two\n        radiometer apertures were equal in the comparison; however,\n        the ARM and Mark II time-constants were 1 second and 5\n        seconds, respectively. By looking at the signal and noise\n        levels during the calibration episodes in!  more detail, we\n        calculate the minimum detectable radiances (MDR) of the two\n        instruments as 4.9 x hz-1/2(ARM) and 6.8 X hz-1/2(CSIRO Mark\n        II).\n\n      Contact:\n\n      C.

These vary from long-period fluctuations induced by planetary waves, oceanic tides, and meteorological forcing events, to relatively shorter-period phenomena such as long surface gravity waves, microseisms, and tsunamis. To capture these events, several types of transducers have been incorporated into pressure sensor units designed for oceanic applications. The most common types include the vibrating wire, strain gauge, quartz-resonator, Bourdon tube, and various capacitance devices. Vibrating wire designs typically correlate vibrational frequency with pressure-induced mechanical motion (Lefcort 1968; Vitousek and Miller 1970). Capacitance plate transducers such as those described by Harris and Tucker (1963) incorporate parallel capacitance plates in which the distance between plates varies as a function of applied pressure. Capacitance is inversely proportional to the plate gap and acts to tune an LC oscillator.\n\nhttp://nctr.pmel.noaa.gov/eble1991.html",

An effort to quantify direct and indirect climate forcing by polar aerosols will be made through a set of closure experiments using observations in conjunction with model calculation and satellite data.\nThe co-operation in the frame of POLAR-AOD will allow the following:\n1. - Definition of calibration procedures among the various sun-radiometers operating in Polar regions, in order to achieve homogeneous AOD (aerosol optical depth) evaluations and maintain a set of reference instruments in a high mountain station. Some of the instruments will be used to constitute a traveller system from one station to the other with the aim of attaining 'round robin' inter-comparison. Regular inter-comparison campaigns (biennial) will be organized in order to compare not only calibration constants but also instrumental characteristics, such as sensitivity and influence of diffuse light. The first inter-comparison campaign, scheduled for spring 2006 at Ny-Alesund, will be used also to define and adjust the methodology and calculation procedures, like that aimed at evaluating relative optical air mass and trace-gas corrections.\n2 . - Improvement of 'in-situ' optical and chemical measurements, with an effort to operate size and time-resolved aerosol composition and concentration sampling on a long-term base (EoI ID 557).\n3. - Establishment of a data bank for spectral sun-photometric measurements (AOD archive), in-situ measurements and any other aerosol related parameters useful for assessing the quantification of aerosols and their radiative effects. This archive will fill the gap for the polar regions within the global aerosol climatology, where there is an urgent need for high-quality data on aerosol abundance and physico-chemical characteristics on a regional scale. The information is necessary to better constrain climate model simulations and improve the interpretation of remotely sensed data. Particular attention will be paid to retrospective analyses of historical data-sets, mainly from Russian Arctic and Antarctic stations. They will be recovered and stored in the archive.\n4. - Determination of reliable procedures for analysing sun-photometric and sun-radiometric data in order to describe realistically the specific conditions occurring in the polar regions. Standard programmes will be developed and supplied to the research groups involved, including cloud rejection algorithms and radiometric data analysis.\n5 - Organisation of international workshops for the presentation of the results from the various polar programs, and for the discussion of common strategies and goals, including aspects of logistics within inter-calibration activities and data exchange.\nIn Antarctica, the actual field activities will benefit from the setting up of a new international long-term monitoring programme, called TAVERN (Quantification of Tropospheric Aerosol and Thin Clouds Variability, including Radiation Budget over the East Antarctic Plateau) at the recently established Italian-French station Dome Concordia (EoI ID 198). Year-round measurements based on LIDAR, Sun and Star photometer and 'in-situ' aerosol systems will make it possible to study in detail inter-annual and seasonal variation of aerosols over the high Antarctic Plateau, and also to obtain information on the thin cloud optical depth. The normal activities in other stations will be extended during the IPY operational period (EoI ID 797). The POLAR-AOD observations will complement the SRB measurements which are developed at other stations (Syowa, South Pole, Neumayer) in the frame of the BSRN (GCOS) activities, providing an important contribution for assessing forcing by aerosols.\nIn the Arctic, additional strong field activities will be promoted at the Greenland Summit Station (EoI ID 530) and Tiksi (EoI ID 820), during the IPY operational period. Real-time measurements of physical, chemical and optical properties of aerosols will allow the constitution of a data set in the Arctic, equivalent to the one acquired over the Antarctic Plateau, Summit being a natural counterpart of Dome Concordia. Also in Ny-Alesund, research activities related to aerosols will increase as a consequence of the efforts of Norway, Poland, Germany, Japan and Italy (EoIs ID 165, ID 597). The network will give support in obtaining high-quality integrated data from the large amount of field activities. Participation on cruises organised in the framework of the Arctic Experiment (AREX) and the airborne ASTAR (Arctic Study of Tropospheric Aerosol, Clouds, and Radiation) activities will lead to a considerable improvement in knowledge on the vertical and spatial distribution of aerosols in the European Arctic. The present studies will complement the activities promoted by the SEARCH Program (NOAA's Study of Environmental Arctic Change). Finally the information obtained will allow participants to assess the influence of mid-latitude aerosol sources in the observed Arctic aerosol budget.\nPOLAR-AOD (EoIs ID 299, ID 557) will join the efforts of the IASOA proposal (EoI ID 138), in the task of co-ordinating different programmes of long-term atmospheric observatories in the Arctic with the purpose of setting up a circumpolar ring around the central Arctic region. The second aim is to fulfil the need for an integrated larger bi-polar network in the field of atmospheric sciences.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=171",

That's why the revealing of such glaciers and observation on their regime are of great scientific and practical importance.\n\nAt present as a result of field investigations, air photos and space images the regularities of fluctuations of many surging glaciers of the Pamirs (Oktyabrskiy, Gando, Bivachniy, Sugran and others) are investigated in detail. The Inventory of Surging Glaciers of the Pamirs was compiled. The experience of monitoring of these glaciers may be distributed at the glaciers of polar regions. That's why it is proposed to fulfil remote sensing investigations of surging glaciers of Alaska, Svalbard and Pamirs on the base of space images. In Alaska investigations of the regime of some surging glaciers (Muldrow, Variegated, Steele and others) were carried out. Usherbreen, Kongsvegen, Duckwitzbreen surging glaciers are the most investigated in the Svalbard.\n\nThe results of investigations of dynamically unstable glaciers in these regions will give an opportunity to define more precisely the elements of remote sensing monitoring of unstable glaciers in polar and continental regions, to clear up likeness and differences in their conditions.",

Results will help constrain the paleo-environmental, tectonic, palynostratigraphic, and paleogeographic histories of southern Pangea and provide a unique polar view of the world during an icehouse to greenhouse transition. \n\nUpper Paleozoic and Lower Mesozoic rocks in SVL and DM were deposited during Gondwanaland's drift across the south pole, and during a transition from Icehouse to Greenhouse conditions following the demise of late Paleozoic glaciation.  Based on present plate reconstructions, SVL and DM were located higher than 75  S from 320 to 210 Ma.  Therefore, SVL and DM strata may provide an unusual high latitude view of the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic world.  However, Permian and Triassic mean pole positions for Gondwanaland are not well constrained and have large errors associated with them. We will attempt to recover Permian and Triassic paleomagnetic signatures from petrified wood, silicified peat, and coal, all of which were cemented during early diagenesis (preliminary results indicate stable remanent magnetizations).\n\nDespite a proposed high latitude position, SVL and DM sedimentary successions record a change from Lower Permian glacigenic deposits, to Permian fluvial coal measures, to Lower Triassic non-carbonaceous fluvial deposits, and finally to Middle and Upper Triassic fluvial coal measures.  Present climatic simulations suggest seasonal climatic extremes within Pangea's polar interior.  Discrepancies between the geological evidence and the climate simulations need to be resolved and may be magnified by incomplete understanding of the influence of paleotopography, large lakes, and river systems at the time of deposition, as well as by incomplete documentation of paleo-environmental conditions.\n\nThe assemblage and drift of Pangea resulted in heightened orogenic activity and associated development of numerous depositional basins.  One of the largest basins was the 10,000+ km long 'Gondwanide foredeep' that extended across southern South America, South Africa, the Falkland Islands, Antarctica, and Australia.  Diachronous tectonism and an inversion tectonics are believed to have occurred along this margin.  Antarctica's centralized location between South Africa and Australia, make SVL and DM key areas for testing these hypotheses.\n\nSummary provided by http://www.uwm.edu/~jisbell/Darwin/Darwin.html",

            "definition": "Indigenous peoples are seeking ways to preserve and protect their traditional knowledge, to incorporate it into both their own decision-making and broader decisions when it is relevant to assessing impacts on indigenous people. At the same time, the ability to exercise some control over indigenous knowledge and maintain its integrity is important. Indigenous people also recognize that their traditional knowledge (TK) may have an economic component and are anxious to share in the benefits that may flow from use of their TK. The fundamental question that this research project seeks to address is how the law responds to these interests of indigenous peoples. What are the alternate legal avenues capable of accepting indigenous claims based on TK and what are the implications both for indigenous people and society more broadly of incorporating TK into the law in these ways? How will recognition and incorporation of TK transform familiar legal landscapes?\nThis study in Northern Canada will provide policy makers and indigenous communities in Canada and other circumpolar nations with insight as to how to protect traditional ecological knowledge and traditional knowledge involving genetic resources. It will explore the legal response to increased participation of indigenous peoples in governance and the incorporation of TK in decision making. Traditional ecological knowledge has the potential to play a major role in developing resource management and environmental policy in Northern Canada. The issue of how to incorporate TK into governance frameworks in this area is particularly pressing given the current resource boom and the ecological pressures resulting from global climate change. The study will utilize first, a review of literature, land claims and self government agreements, agreements in principle and statutes and regulations to assess TK discourse, meanings, and governance and second a case study approach in collaboration with communities in the Nunavut, Northwest Territory and Yukon to answer the following questions.\nConceptual and Factual Inquiry:\n1) Does TK exist as a single conceptual idea or is it just a way of referring to a set of (not necessarily similar) concerns?\n2) If TK is a single idea, to what extent, if at all, does it differ from other forms of knowledge with which we are more familiar?\n3) What is the connection between those holding TK and the TK? Is there a common connection or a variety of connections (religious, medicinal, economic, etc.)?\nLegal Questions:\n4) Does the nature of the connection in (3) give rise to rights in or to TK?\n5) If so, what are the legal alternatives to providing those rights (property, liability rules, acknowledgement, inalienability, constitutional protection)? 6) Do the connections and the availability of alternative forms of protection fit within justifications given for property rights? If not, which of the alternatives is best justified?\nConstitutional Questions:\nOne focus of our research is to explore whether TK in itself has any constitutional protection as an aboriginal right under s. 35 of the Canadian Constitution, or alternatively whether particular dimensions of TK may have some constitutional status as an integral aspect of broader rights. Protection of TK within the framework of rights to self-governance would provide indigenous people with the capacity to develop their own legal institutions relating to TK. We plan to explore the extent of rights and their interaction with other regulatory regimes, e.g., environmental and natural resource legislation. We also plan to explore the connection point between TK and indigenous rights under s. 35 and the duty of consultation and accommodation recently articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada.\nWhile some of these questions arise in a Canadian Constitutional context, the interplay of rights discourse and TK has a broader significance in national and international law in circumpolar regions. We plan to explore all potential intersection points between TK and international, national, regional and private rules or norms with the aim of developing national and international guidelines for the protection of TK.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=206",

The information is ultimately used to predict sea level rise accompanying global warming and interpret climate change records. The GPS (global positioning system) stations measure vertical and horizontal movements of bedrock, while the seismic stations characterize physical properties of the ice/rock interface, lithosphere, and mantle. Combined with satellite data, this project offers a more complete picture of the ice sheet's current state, its likely change in the near future, and its overall size during the last glacial maximum. This data will also be used to infer sub-ice sheet geology and the terrestrial heat flux, critical inputs to models of glacier movement. As well, this project improves tomographic models of the earth's deep interior and core through its location in the Earth's poorly instrumented southern hemisphere. \n\nBroader impacts of this project are varied. The work is relevant to society for improving our understanding of the impacts of global warming on sea level rise. It also supports education at the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels, and outreach to groups underrepresented in the sciences. As an International Polar Year contribution, this project establishes a legacy of infrastructure for polar measurements. It also involves an international collaboration of twenty four countries.

Activities will be focused on deployment of autonomous observatories at remote sites on the continents and offshore, coordinated with measurements made at permanent station observatories and by satellite campaigns. Measurements (in situ, satellite and airborne) will include GPS (w/ GLONASS, Galileo; GPS occultation/meteorological sensors), seismic, gravity (absolute and relative), geomagnetic, tide gauges (at coastal sites, or as ocean bottom sensors), and oceanographic (in situ and altimetry) and chemical (at offshore sites). Many sites will be augmented by meteorological sensors. Multidisciplinary deep sea observatories on the polar seafloor will perform continuous collection of geophysical, oceanographic and geochemical data. This initiative will overcome the scarcity of observational systems in the Earth's polar regions, and will provide a legacy in observational infrastructure and the technological capability to overcome the challenges of autonomous operations in extreme environments. \n\nGeodetic studies, including GPS measurements of crustal motion, tide-gauge measurements of relative sea-level change, and gravity measurements of mass change, constitute essential elements in developing an understanding of the stability and mass balance of the cryosphere and of ongoing sea-level change. There is a critical need to understand the contribution to sea-level change due to changes in mass balance of the major ice sheets of the world, most importantly the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Accurate measurement of millimeter-scale vertical and horizontal crustal motions is possible in only 2-5 years if continuous GPS trackers are deployed. Deployment of C-GPS stations at sufficiently high spatial resolution, and co-located GPS and absolute gravity measurements, will allow discrimination of the elastic response to modern mass change from the secular viscoelastic response to ancient ice mass change. Present-day rebound models are least well constrained in the polar regions and a bi-polar effort during IPY will reduce uncertainty levels and allow more reliable ice history models to be constructed. Together with satellite-based measurement of ice volume and mass change (ICESat, GRACE, GFO, ENVISAT, CRYOSAT), we can use these data to provide robust constraints on ice models and earth models, improving our ability to quantify ice mass loss/gain and sea-level change. Deployment of C-GPS stations across tectonic blocks and boundaries allows crustal motions due to global plate motion and intraplate neotectonic deformation to be measured and velocity fields to be mapped and modeled.\n\nSeismological data from the observatories will provide the first relatively high-resolution data on the Earth beneath the polar seas and ice sheets. Advanced techniques to image the Earths deep interior, such as seismic tomography, will be used to place constraints on the planets internal processes. Seismic imaging of the crust and mantle will assess causes for anomalously high elevations in East Antarctica, linked with ice sheet development, will provide information on heat flow and mantle viscosity that are key factors controlling ice sheet dynamics and the Earth's response to ice mass change, and will provide constraints on the magma sources for polar volcanism. Enhanced seismic station coverage will vastly improve the detection level for earthquakes and permit evaluation of seismotectonic activity and associated seismic hazard across the remote high latitudes. The axial vantage points of the poles will allow unprecedented studies of Earth's inner core, contributing to our understanding of the initial differentiation of the Earth, the Earth's thermal history, and the physics and variability of the Earth's magnetic field.",

The joint U.S.-Japan Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite was launched in November 1997 and uses a Ku-band radar and a multi-channel passive microwave radiometer to map precipitation in the tropics. A number of physical assumptions are made within the TRMM satellite algorithms in order to obtain rain rates from the the satellite-measured radiances. The goals of KWAJEX were focused on making observations to reduce uncertainty in these physical assumptions by gathering a coordinated data set of airborne, shipborne, and ground-based measurements within tropical open ocean precipitating clouds. This site integrates information on the specific measurements made during the KWAJEX field campaign and on the ongoing data processing and analysis.       \n\nProject Contacts:\n      \nSandra Yuter  yuter@atmos.washington.edu\nRobert A.

Preservation of the existing record and continuation of the\nLandsat capability were identified in the law as critical to land\nsurface monitoring and global change research.\n\nLandsat 7 has a unique and essential role in the realm of earth\nobserving satellites in orbit. No other earth observing system matches\nLandsat's combination of synoptic coverage, high spatial resolution,\nspectral range and radiometric calibration. In addition, the Landsat\nProgram is committed to provide Landsat digital data to the user\ncommunity in greater quantities, more quickly and at lower cost than\nat any previous time in the history of the program.\n\nThe Landsat 7 spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin, Valley Forge,\nPennsylvania. The ETM+ instrument is a product of Hughes Santa Barbara\nRemote Sensing. Construction of both was managed through contracts\nbetween the manufacturers and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,\nGreenbelt, Maryland.\n\nThe Landsat Program, as defined by Congress in 1992 and amended by\nPresidential Decision Directive/NSTC-3 in May, 1994, was managed\ncooperatively by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n(NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),\nand the USGS. NASA was responsibility for construction of the\nspacecraft and instrument. The Landsat Program is part of the NASA's\nglobal change initiative - the Earth Observing System, administered by\nthe NASA Office of Mission to Planet Earth. NOAA no longer\nparticipates in the Landsat 7 program. Landsat 7 is now operated by\nUSGS. Data processing, archiving and distribution is performed by\nUSGS. These functions will be executed in coordination with the EDC\nDistributed Active Archive Center (EDC DAAC) of NASA's Earth Observing\nSystem Data and Information System (EOSDIS) at EDC.\n\nFor more information on Landsat and Landsat 7, see:\n'http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/'\nand\n'http://landsat7.usgs.gov/index.php'\n\nFor more information on the Earth Observing System (EOS), see:\n'http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/'",

Using a laser,a telescope approximately 1 meter\nin diameter and a modular design, the system will be used to\nstudy clouds, trophospheric and stratospheric aerosols,\ncharacteristics of the planetary boundary layer, stratospheric\ndensity and temperature pertubations, and to some degree,\nsurface topography. The greatly improved resolution of LITE\nwith respect to passive sensors is expected to provide a new\nand unique data set on the global distribution and optical\nproperties of clouds and aerosols , and therefore, their\nradiative and chemical effects. In addition, this data set will\nbe useful in validating and improving retrieval algorithms\nalready in use. Similarly, the ability to accurately locate the\ntop of the planetary boundary layer will aid in global climate\nmodel(GCM) parameterizations of flux transport between the\noceans and th!  e atmosphere. Measurements of density\npertubations in the middle stratosphere will provide a greatly\nimproved glimpse of the global dynamics of this region compared\nto that given by current spaceborne sensors. The primary goals\nof LITE are to demonstrate the maturity of space-based lidar\ntechnology, to provide some unique measurements, and to provide\na platform for the development of technology for future\nspace-based systems.\n\nFor more information, link to\n'http://asd-www.larc.nasa.gov/lite/ASDlite.html'",

            "definition": "The Lead Experiment (LeadEx) was a experiment sponsored by the Office of\nNaval Research (ONR) to study the crack-like openings called leads\nthat are created by the deformation of Arctic pack ice. The study was\nconducted by a group of scientists from various institutions and\ndisciplines to clarify the effect of open leads on the polar ocean and\natmosphere and to further understanding of the role of polar regions\non climate and global change.\nThe LeadEx was conducted during March and April 1992 in the Beaufort\nSea approximately 300 km north of Deadhorse, Alaska.\nLeads range from a few meters to thousands of meters wide and have\nlong been considered important to the thermodynamics of the polar\nregions. Leads can account for nearly half of the total heat flux from\nthe ocean (Badgley, 1966) because the lead exposed relatively warm\nwater to the cold atmosphere. Leads have a major effect on the\nsalinity of the ocean mixed layer.\nThe LeadEx program began in 1990 with funding from the ONR Accelerated\nResearch Initiative. Initial studies were made at the University of\nArizona and the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of\nWashington.\nThe main experiment began on March 16, 1992 with the establishment of\na base camp that drifted generally westward until the program ended on\nApril 25, 1992. Weather forecasts and remote sensing data were\nprovided by the LeadEx weather center at the National Weather Service\n(NWS) in Anchorage, Alaska. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) at\nMonterey, CA transmitted mesoscale meteorological model forecasts of\nwind, temperature, moisture, and cloud height to the LeadEx weather\ncenter twice daily. Near-real-time high-resolution satellite data from\nNOAA satellites and DMSP satellites were also made available.\nHuts and equipment were deployed from the main base camp to four sites\ncalled Lead 1 - Lead 4. Most of the data were gathered at Lead 3 and 4\nsince Leads 1 and 2 were closed soon after the sites were occupied.\nHelicopter and research aircraft made numerous oceanographic and\nmeteorological measurements.\nMeteorological effects were measured primarily by the Wave Propogation\nLaboratory (WPL) in Boulder, CO. WPL instrumentation included sonic\nanemometers, pyranometers and pyrgeometers, and 6.5 kHz SODARs.\nRawinsondes were launched by WPL to support atmospheric soundings\nconducted by the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, CA. The\nNOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) and NPS deployed\ndrifting buoys.\nSeveral aircraft programs were conducted using the University of\nWashington Convair C-131A and a DeHavilland Twin Otter (DHC-6). The\ngroup measured atmospheric temperature, water vapor concentrations and\nbiogenic emissions of dimethylsulfide (DMS) from leads. A\nhigh-resolution, down-looking infrared thermometer was used on both\naircraft.\nGrowth rate of ice in the leads was measured by groups from PSC using\nfreeze-in buoys. Physical properties of the ice was measured by the\nCold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL).\nRemote sensing applications for ice studies was conducted by the\nDepartment of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington to\ndetermine microwave and infrared brightness temperatures of thin ice\nin the freezing leads and selected first-year ice. Observations were\nmade at 6.7, 10, 18.7, 37 GHz and 10 microns. A team from the\nEnvironmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM) measured radar\nbackscatter at multiple frequencies, polarizations, and angles\nsimultaneously. A group from Williamson and Associates measured\nthermally induced stress in the lead ice.\nOceanographic measurements included profiles of conductivity,\ntemperature, turbulent shear, and acoustic backscatter. The McPhee\nResearch Company (MRC) used a mast of multiple sensors to obtain time\nseries of mean velocity, temperature, and salinity and turbulent\nfluxes. PSC used an untethered Autonomous Conductivity Temperature\nVehicle (ACTV) which carried a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD)\nprobe. A specialized pontoon boat from the Oregon State University was\nused to measure the microstructure of leads. A group from Scripps\nInstitution of Oceanography used a sector-scan, multibeam, Doppler\nsonar.\nReference:\nBadgley, F.J. 1966.

All decisions and approval of\n proposals for research activities rest with the Headquarters of\n JARE under the chairmanship of the Minister of Education,\n Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Secretariat of the\n JARE Headquarters belongs to the Science and International\n Affairs Bureau, Monbukagakusho.  The task of NIPR is to operate\n JARE both for scientific programs and logistics, except the\n transportation of personnel and materials by the icebreaker\n Shirase from Japan to Antarctica. Scientific programs at Syowa\n Station cover the following fields: upper atmosphere physics,\n meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy and cartography,\n oceanography, glaciology, geology, geography, marine and\n terrestrial biology, and medical research. Programs offered on\n board the Shirase include the following subjects: ionosphere,\n meteorology, geomagnetism, gravimetry, and physical, chemical\n and biological oceanography.  All Japanese scientific stations\n in Antarctica belong to NIPR. Syowa Station, the mother station\n of JARE, was established in January 1957, at 69?00'S and\n 39?35'E on East Ongul Island, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East\n Antarctica. The total floor area of the buildings has increased\n from 184m? (3 buildings) in 1957 to 5,930.5m? (48 buildings)\n and other outdoor facilities in 2001.  Mizuho Station was\n established in July 1970 along the geomagnetic meridian passing\n through Syowa Station. It is located on the inland ice sheet at\n 70?42'S and 44?20'E (2,230m above sea level), about 270km\n southeast of Syowa. After intermittent occupation, a few\n members maintained year-round operation from 1976 to 1986,\n making observations on meteorology, glaciology, and upper\n atmosphere physics.  It has been closed since 1987 and is\n occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and\n glaciological observations.  Asuka Station was established in\n December 1984 on the ice sheet north of the Sor-Rondane\n Mountains, at 71?32'S and 24?08'E (930m above sea level). Most\n of the station facilities of about 450m? in total floor area\n have become buried under snow. The principal role of the\n station is to support field work in geology, geomorphology,\n meteorite searches, glaciology and biology in the Sor-Rondane\n Mountains. However, year-round observations including\n meteorology, glaciology, solid earth geophysics, and upper\n atmosphere physics were conducted between 1987 to 1991. Since\n 1991, the station activities have been suspended. Dome Fuji\n Station equipped with 8 buildings, 407m? in total, was\n established in 1995 at 77?19'01'S and 39?42'12'E (3,810m above\n sea level) for the deep drilling program and atmospheric\n observations.  In recent years, environmental protection of\n Antarctica and its unique ecosystems has become increasingly\n important in planning and conducting Antarctic research. In\n accordance with the protocol on environmental protection in the\n Antarctic Treaty, appropriate procedures for environmental\n protection are followed in the Japanese Antarctic Research\n Expeditions.  A new program for monitoring changes in global\n and regional environments and ecosystems was started at Syowa\n Station and its coastal and inland vicinity in 1997. The\n monitoring programs include major parameters of atmospheric\n glaciological, solid geophysical and biological changes, such\n as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, sea level,\n population of penguins etc. Pollutants in seawater, ice or snow\n and in animals, such as heavy metals and organic chlorinated\n compounds derived from global and regional sources, are\n occasionally measured. The monitoring of global environmental\n change is an essential part of basic scientific programs as\n described in the previous chapter.\n\nFor more information,\nlink to 'http://www.nipr.ac.jp/english/antarctic/t01_jare.html'\n\n[Summary provided by National Institute of Polar Research]",

Faced with minority languages, governments have pursued policies of assimilation. This has applied to indigenous languages in Canada, to Gaelic and Scots in Scotland, and to Finnic minority languages in the Circumpolar region. The consequence of such policies has been the creation of ambivalent or negative feelings towards the mother tongue already in childhood, leading to low self-esteem, educational underachievement, unemployment and economic deprivation, and a variety of social and health problems. It is thus clear that language and culture are as important to the survival and well-being of populations as more obvious ecological and social issues.\n\nThe aim of the project is twofold: firstly, to create an electronic framework for the collection, management, online display, and exploitation of existing corpora of the languages of the circumpolar regions, which is also applicable to other corpora that represent regional, social and other varieties of languages. To achieve this we rely on close collaboration between several well-established corpus projects to discuss common goals, needs and problems and to identify best practices. Secondly, the project aims to collect, preserve and disseminate information about the languages spoken in the region, thus also enabling research on them. This will also help promote the linguistic confidence and self-image of the speakers of these languages, strengthening their cultural awareness and facilitating cross-cultural communication between these peoples in an age of rapid global change. Thus, the project will benefit not only the academic community, but also the speakers of the languages concerned, and indeed other communities around the world battling with the same kinds of issues.\n\nThe electronic framework is being developed at the University of Oulu, Finland, as a joint venture between the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Humanities and in collaboration with other project members and international experts. Within IPY 2007-2008 both an intranet and an internet version of the framework will be developed. In addition to this the project members will participate in the collection of data and dissemination of information. Each member has a unique goal within the project: some already have data, which may need digitization or formatting to be usable within the framework; others are looking to collect data. All members share a need for common practices and common tools to make the most use out of the data available.",

At the same time, the RV Yuzhmorgeologiya completed nearly three passes through the nearshore-to-shelf-break survey grid. Stations throughout the survey were occupied at night where CTD and net tow stations were conducted. Also included in this field season were preliminary  ... tests of a AUV (Fetch I, Sias-Patterson) which was deployed to conduct bathymetry mapping and determine whether krill swarms could be detected by the vehicle. The AUV work was conducted with Dr. Mark Patterson of VIMS and Sias-Patterson and the Advanced Survey Technologies group at SWFSC led by Dr. David Demer. Except for a near gale which occurred exactly mid-way during the survey period, good weather allowed for extensive survey effort. In addition, instrumented buoys were deployed to test a new engineering design of the buoys used in previous field seasons. Due to technical issues, only limited data were collected during the buoy deployment.\n\n2006 Field season: During 1-10 February, the RV Ernest surveyed over 264 n. mi. collecting acoustic backscatter data. At the same time, the RV Yuzhmorgeologiya completed two passes through the nearshore-to-shelf-break survey grid. Stations throughout the survey were occupied at night where CTD and net tow stations were conducted. An additional small vessel (RV Roald) was deployed with a SIMRAD MS 20 Multibeam echosounder to map bathymetry of the nearshore area and to study krill swarm characteristics. Joint operations (specific survey lines) were conducted with all three vessels). Poor weather and sea state conditions resulted in the loss of two days of survey effort at the beginning and 1 day at the end of the period. We still managed to conduct a comparable amount of survey effort as in 2005 due to few (if any) equipment or vessel malfunctions. Instrumented buoys were deployed and collected data over several days of the survey period.\n\n2007 Field season: During 28 January to 1 February, the RV Ernest surveyed approximately 55 n.mi. collecting acoustic backscatter data. At the same time, the RV Yuzhmorgeologiya completed slightly more than one pass through the nearshore-to-shelf-break survey grid. Stations throughout the survey were occupied at night where CTD and net tow stations were conducted. An additional small vessel (RV Roald) was deployed with a SIMRAD MS 20 Multibeam echosounder to map bathymetry of the nearshore area and to study krill swarm characteristics. Joint operations (specific survey lines) were conducted with the two smaller vessels).The shorter survey period during this field season was a combination of several factors: reduced shiptime for the AMLR survey due to NOAA budgetary constraints (10 day survey period reduced to 7 days) and a combination of weather delays during the AMLR broad area survey and problems with the calibration of the RV Yuzhmorgeologiya echosounder system (7 to 5 days). In addition, during our reduced survey window, we experienced extremely poor weather and dangerous sea conditions which forced us to remain on shore and also damaged equipment when we did venture out. Despite these conditions, we were able to collect data from all three research vessels (Ernest, Roald, Yuzhmorgeologiya) to provide a 3rd year of data for this project. One instrumented buoy was deployed at the start of the nearshore survey period and collected data throughout the survey period.",

Although the jungle's area is so large that it reaches out into several different countries, most of its area is located within the Brazilian territory. Despite three centuries of scientific study in Amazonia, only a small fraction of its biological richness has been revealed. \n\nhttp://daac.ornl.gov/LBA/lba.shtml\n\nSummary provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory.]",

The multi-disciplinal and multi-national initiative is composed by 26 projects, having individual goals, but well integrated common themes (http://www.eld.geo.uu.se/IPY/projects). The spectrum of projects from geosciences to the humanities, investigates how the environmental and anthropogenic dynamics have changed recently in comparison with past records of change from existing expedition logs and photographs, proxy climate data from ice-, lake- and sea-sediment cores, and dynamic studies both on terrestrial as marine ice, comprising more than 80 Principal Investigators (www.eld.geo.uu.se/IPY/personnel). \n\nWe will monitor atmospheric, terrestrial and cryospheric chemical, and physical fluxes continuously over, and beyond, the period of the IPY. The activities will be integrated to existing research and monitoring in Svalbard as well as to relevant IPY projects to which Kinnvika base will serve an important add on site.Historical remains in the field and in archives from a succession of cultures of whale hunting, trapping, exploration and mineral exploitation are abundant on Nordaustlandet and northwestern Spitsbergen. Economic change and cultural variability are major themes in the interdisciplinary humanistic research that will investigate these traces at significant sites, esp. natural harbors located at good hunting grounds of the past. Historical archaeology, including pioneering arctic marine archaeology, will be combined with scientific investigations of e.g. soil chemistry, erosion and local biological alterations resulting from human interaction with the wilderness of Spitsbergen. History of science will be a major integrating endeavor in this, relating a temporal and geographical sequence of aboriginal and Western knowledge projects to the crucial transition from colonial to post-colonial arctic science and scholarship.Earlier research expedition data viewed through modern surveys and data gathering will provide data on the degree of change and variability in this particular system. Proxy-records from a variety of natural archives will bring a time-dimension to more process-focused or monitoring studies. Special attention will be paid to the response of the cryosphere to past climate and environmental changes. This is closely linked to geological assessment of glacial history and monitoring of atmospheric pollutant transport pathways. Advanced statistical methods and numerical models will be used to elucidate linkages between the systems and global teleconnections. In addition the biological legacy of the 1957-58 IGY will be explored via investigation of anthropogenically disturbed vegetation, soils, and soil biology (invertebrates, microbes) to determine the persistence of human influence on semi-desert ecosystems. We aim to provide a platform for broadband scientific endeavour into a relatively poorly investigated part of the Svalbard Archipelago. The plethora of instruments and methods we plan to unleash are required to fully measure change and variability in the Arctic system both from the human use to the resonances within the natural system. For synergies sought between different research fields, see (www.eld.geo.uu.se/IPY/synergies).We will provide a legacy in the form of a renovated scientific base for future, primarily Nordic field research on Nordaustlandet",

The voyages of discovery in the second half of the 16th century and later, during the so called Heroic Century of Polar Exploration (1870-1920), including the first International Polar Year (1882-1883), made it possible for the western colonial powers to penetrate into the polar areas. The voyages of discovery not only led to the exploitation of natural resources but also to scientific research. In both cases, stations were built to facilitate the work and to lodge the people. According to Friedmanns core/periphery concept (1966) the polar areas can be called Resource Frontier Regions because they produce raw material for the industrial centres in the world core areas (Sugden 1982). Whaling, fur hunting and mining have produced raw materials for the international market for more than 400 years. These activities were carried out by companies and people from outside the polar regions. The companies belonged to the worldwide actor networks (Latour 1986, Law & Callon 1992) in the core areas and local networks in the polar areas.It is notable how similar the developments were in both polar areas. One can divide the exploitation of natural resources in both areas into two phases: directly after the discovery a first phase in which fur hunters and whalers from different countries were active and a second phase in which the activities were focussed on the exploitation of minerals.Scientific research has increased the knowledge of both areas and contributed to the understanding of global processes. The industrial settlements and the research stations have played an important geopolitical role and have serious impact on the natural environment and in the Arctic on indigenous communities. Many sites belong to the polar cultural heritage nowadays. \n\nAim and strategy:\n\nUntil now, the history of science in and exploitation of polar areas were almost exclusively studied from a regional and national approach based on written sources from the archives in the countries in the core region. The aim of this project is to study the various (hunting, whaling, mining and research) settlements/stations from a bipolar, international and comparative perspective. Field and archive research will be done to collect the necessary data. The outcome of the various studies will be compared with each other to acquire more knowledge about the history of scientific research and the exploitation of the natural resources, the impact on the natural environment and the indigenous peoples. Finally the geopolitical consequences of the stations will be studied using written and material sources.The project will start in 2006 with archive research carried out to acquire more insight into the historical context. Much archive research will be done by the participants of the project in their various countries. This will produce a body of documentation, photo and film material which may be used not only for research but also in outreach activities. Field surveys will be carried out jointly on various already known sites in both polar areas. Several selected sites will be mapped and photo documented completely and compared with archival data. In 2007-2008 field work will be done on places difficult to reach. The data analysis of the various sites will be carried out jointly. The databases and maps will be collected in Groningen and made available for cultural heritage purposes and outreach activities. Finally a synthesis will be made which will be published in a joint publication in English and translated in several other languages.",

All decisions and approval of\n    proposals for research activities rest with the Headquarters of\n    JARE under the chairmanship of the Minister of Education,\n    Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Secretariat of the\n    JARE Headquarters belongs to the Science and International\n    Affairs Bureau, Monbukagakusho.  The task of NIPR is to operate\n    JARE both for scientific programs and logistics, except the\n    transportation of personnel and materials by the icebreaker\n    Shirase from Japan to Antarctica. Scientific programs at Syowa\n    Station cover the following fields: upper atmosphere physics,\n    meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy and cartography,\n    oceanography, glaciology, geology, geography, marine and\n    terrestrial biology, and medical research. Programs offered on\n    board the Shirase include the following subjects: ionosphere,\n    meteorology, geomagnetism, gravimetry, and physical, chemical\n    and biological oceanography.  All Japanese scientific stations\n    in Antarctica belong to NIPR. Syowa Station, the mother station\n    of JARE, was established in January 1957, at 69?00'S and\n    39?35'E on East Ongul Island, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East\n    Antarctica. The total floor area of the buildings has increased\n    from 184m? (3 buildings) in 1957 to 5,930.5m? (48 buildings)\n    and other outdoor facilities in 2001.  Mizuho Station was\n    established in July 1970 along the geomagnetic meridian passing\n    through Syowa Station. It is located on the inland ice sheet at\n    70?42'S and 44?20'E (2,230m above sea level), about 270km\n    southeast of Syowa. After intermittent occupation, a few\n    members maintained year-round operation from 1976 to 1986,\n    making observations on meteorology, glaciology, and upper\n    atmosphere physics.  It has been closed since 1987 and is\n    occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and\n    glaciological observations.  Asuka Station was established in\n    December 1984 on the ice sheet north of the Sor-Rondane\n    Mountains, at 71?32'S and 24?08'E (930m above sea level). Most\n    of the station facilities of about 450m? in total floor area\n    have become buried under snow. The principal role of the\n    station is to support field work in geology, geomorphology,\n    meteorite searches, glaciology and biology in the Sor-Rondane\n    Mountains. However, year-round observations including\n    meteorology, glaciology, solid earth geophysics, and upper\n    atmosphere physics were conducted between 1987 to 1991. Since\n    1991, the station activities have been suspended. Dome Fuji\n    Station equipped with 8 buildings, 407m? in total, was\n    established in 1995 at 77?19'01'S and 39?42'12'E (3,810m above\n    sea level) for the deep drilling program and atmospheric\n    observations.  In recent years, environmental protection of\n    Antarctica and its unique ecosystems has become increasingly\n    important in planning and conducting Antarctic research. In\n    accordance with the protocol on environmental protection in the\n    Antarctic Treaty, appropriate procedures for environmental\n    protection are followed in the Japanese Antarctic Research\n    Expeditions.  A new program for monitoring changes in global\n    and regional environments and ecosystems was started at Syowa\n    Station and its coastal and inland vicinity in 1997. The\n    monitoring programs include major parameters of atmospheric\n    glaciological, solid geophysical and biological changes, such\n    as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, sea level,\n    population of penguins etc. Pollutants in seawater, ice or snow\n    and in animals, such as heavy metals and organic chlorinated\n    compounds derived from global and regional sources, are\n    occasionally measured. The monitoring of global environmental\n    change is an essential part of basic scientific programs as\n    described in the previous chapter.\n\n   For more information,\n   link to 'http://www.nipr.ac.jp/english/antarctic/t01_jare.html'\n\n   [Summary provided by National Institute of Polar Research]",

The main project objective was to improve forecasting of lake-effect snowstorms and freezing rain events over and near Lake Ontario. Guidance for field operations was provided by a lead forecaster at the NWS Forecast Office in Buffalo, New York, who worked with a project forecast committee. A lake snow outlook was provided four times daily. Data from ground-based project facilities as well as model output from a locally run version of the Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU–NCAR) Mesoscale Model version 4 MM4 were used to assist forecasters. The focus in LOWS was on precipitation and not on PBL development, and measurement facilities did not include aircraft. Thus, project forecasters did not explicitly have to target features like PBL depth or visibility so they could take advantage of existing statistical models and decision trees (e.g., machines) for lake-effect snow.\n\nSummary provided by http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1175%2F1520-0434(1999)014%3C0955%3AFDTLIS%3E2.0.CO%3B2&ct=1",

Conventional and modern techniques, i.e., culture-dependent to meta-genomic approaches will be used to analyze community structure and biogeography of Polar terrestrial, limnetic and supraglacial ecosystems. Addressing this theme will produce reference collections of Polar organisms and genetic material such as bulk environmental DNA. Selected groups of organisms will be studied to associate species diversification with geographical separation, and to screen for unique physiological and biochemical functions that occur in response to the extreme conditions of polar habitats.\n\nTheme 2: Food webs and ecosystem evolution will answer the question 'How do high-latitude biota interact and function?' Food webs in polar habitats have reduced complexity relative to lower latitudes and are thus likely to be sensitive to changes in species composition. Food web analyses have also highlighted the vulnerability of polar terrestrial ecosystems to climate changes. Palaeo-environmental analysis of diatoms, chemical biomarkers and other records in lake sediment cores have the potential to reveal how climate and environmental changes have driven species successions and ecosystem evolution. Process studies will include analysis of microbial production and interactions, in addition to carbon and nitrogen cycling including microbial controls on CO2 and CH4 dynamics.\n\nTheme 3: Linkages between biological, chemical and physical processes in the supraglacial biome lucidates 'How do physical, chemical and biological processes interact in icy ecosystems?' Supraglacial habitats include water-saturated snow, supraglacial channels, cryoconite holes and veins in ice. Biogeochemical processes in these environments transform atmospheric inputs to the glacier, in a similar way that watershed surfaces modify atmospheric inputs in temperate environments. This work will document the range and nature of aquatic ecosystems on the surfaces of glaciers in the Arctic and Antarctic. In doing so controls on biological productivity (physical, chemical, biological); key biogeochemical transformations; and linkages between biological activity and atmospheric fluxes of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus to glacial surfaces will be characterised. Some complementary studies will also be undertaken on ice shelf cryo-ecosystems that occur in both polar regions and that have some microbiological similarities to cryoconite systems.\n\nThe major purpose of the MERGE umbrella is to provide and expand the chances for sharing/exchanging/offering data, samples, logistics, expedition opportunities, field facilities, laboratories, analytical instruments, etc between the research themes.\n\nMERGE contributes to the EBA SCAR programme.",

We also propose to coordinate observations from other International Polar Year (IPY) activities that might benefit from ISS observations.\nThe orbit of the ISS takes it to north and south latitudes of 51.6 degrees at altitudes of 400 km. This provides a human operated platform from which to observe artic and Antarctic phenomena on a length scale of half a continent. This compliments ground site observations and satellite data that can be synchronized in both space and time to record seasonal variations. Observations from the ISS offers an above the cloud vantage including wide angle oblique views, sun-glint textures, day-night terminator lighting, and perhaps most important, human guided observations that can fall outside the purview of pre-programmed field of view instrumentation. The ISS offers a unique platform for Antarctic atmospheric observations since it gives repeated coverage circumscribing the continent every few days where cloud cover the general lack of observation sites limits routine ground observations over long periods of time.\nWe propose to use the current observational equipment on ISS including a suite of digital still cameras, standard video cameras, and a medium resolution, fiber optic coupled visible region spectrograph. We are planning the fabrication for use on ISS of an IMAX-sized format, CCD camera optimised for low light level video if funding permits. With the NASA presidential directive for human exploration beyond Earth orbit, NASA is considering astronaut training in polar regions as analogues for human planetary missions. We propose to coordinate these polar analogue activities with ISS observations.\nParticipation in this proposal will be open to all international partners to ISS as well as any other project that wishes to coordinate observations with ISS. All ISS collected data will be archived and publicly distributed using current NASA infrastructure. This activity offers great potential for educational outreach by linking human exploration from Earth polar extremes to Earth orbital extremes to Lunar and Martian extremes. The outreach will use current NASA educational infrastructure.\nBackground\nThis proposal resulted from prior collaborations when the Lead Contact was a crewmember and Science Officer on Expedition 6 to ISS. During this expedition, synchronized aurora observations were made between ISS and ground observers in Finland. Observations of Antarctic PMC were routinely made and subsequently correlated with SNOE satellite data with collaborators from University of Colorado and University of Alaska. These efforts proved the utility of making synchronized observations between ISS, ground, and satellite and resulted in this proposal. This proposal has been submitted with the approval of Dr. Jim Garvin, NASA Chief Scientist, in the NASA Washington DC office.\nD. R. Pettit, D. W. Rusch, G. E. Thomas, A. Merkel, S. Bailey, J. M.

Undergraduate interns and research students received GIS training and undertook these activities as a means to acquire fundamental skills and analytical experience in GIS through original research focused on a contemporary question in Antarctic science.\n\nThe topics for original research for undergraduates were determined on the basis of priorities determined by the international ANTscape: Antarctic paleotopography working group (antscape.org) formed under the auspices of the Antarctic Climate Evolution (ACE) initiative. DigitalGlobe imagery was integrated in the GIS and draped upon DEMS in order to examine and quantify aspect of areas determined to be of significance for climate, ice sheet, or tectonics.  \n\nThe database management and construction component educated students and provided a framework for acquisition of fundamental skills through use of ArcGIS, ENVI, and GlobalMapper. Students learned about a tectonically active region of Earth that is undergoing deglaciation and climate change. The students used the GIS and satellite imagery for inquiry and interpretation of a geological-glacial setting within the region of West Antarctica, a dynamic region that had never been examined within a single geospatial framework such as that provided by LIMA (http://lima.usgs.gov/).\n\nDuring the time of the award, seven undergraduates developed proficiency in GIS to aid their future employment or academic pursuits, while exploring research questions relating to bedrock structure and Antarctic climate evolution. Four of these completed internships at the Polar Geospatial Center, University of Minnesota, who supported the research. Server configuration and internet formats are being finalized in 2013-14, in preparation to provide electronic access to the scientific community in USA and abroad will gain access to the on-line repository of  Ford Ranges geological data and digital elevation models that provide the first accurate elevation data for this region.\n\nThe host institution is in the process of reconfiguring servers in 2013; once this is completed URLs for access to the online geology GIS and DEMs will be provided at this site.",

The first is to carry out high- quality measurements of carbon dioxide (CO 2) system parameters that can be used to document the transient invasion of fossil fuel derived CO 2 into the ocean&#039;s interior. The second is to utilize these observations in ocean and atmosphere general circulation models to enable more accurate predictions of future climate change on decadal to centennial timescales. In support of these objectives, the OACES program has been making carbon system measurements on deep ocean survey cruises as well as time-series measurements of atmospheric l2CO 2 and 13CO 2 at NOAA&#039;s global cooperative flask sampling network sites. \n\nProgram Interfaces: \nThe OACES program addresses research relevant to the goals of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (U.S. JGOFS), a core activity of the International Geosphere- Biosphere Programme (IGBP). OACES research is also relevant to activities of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) program, also of IGBP. The IGAC program includes global measurements and modeling of atmospheric CO 2 and its isotopic composition. With respect to NASA, the oceanic measurements made along meridional ocean sections and process study cruises supported by OACES will provide valuable information to the NASA SeaWIFS Ocean Color Satellite mission, namely in situ ocean data that can be used to validate information derived from the satellite (i.e., &ground-truthing&). Another partner in the quest to understand the global carbon cycle is the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). In addition to supporting CO 2 measurements on World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) cruises, DOE is providing certified seawater reference materials to investigators to ensure the analytical quality control of seawater total CO 2 measurements. \n\nInformation provided by http://www.gcrio.org/ocp96/progsum/DOC_09.html",

The polar regions at the Northern hemisphere have myriads of freshwater lakes that are integrated parts of the polar biome and thus are irrevocable sites for many ecosystem processes. \nArctic lakes are unique in a number of ways. The most obvious being the physical and chemical conditions that often imply a very harsh environment with low nutrient variability, low temperatures, long ice coverage and highly variable microclimate. The biodiversity as well as productivity of species in such lakes is often low and the food web structures often simple. This implies that arctic lakes are vulnerable to disturbance of almost any kind (air pollution, over exploitation, acidification, eutrophication and climate changes). \nFreshwater lakes are essential in many ways as they provide breeding habitats for birds, are the nursing ground for many insect larval stages, host valuable fish populations (salmon, charr and trout), act as buffer zones for melt waters, provides drinking water and transportation corridors for wild life and humans.\nRecent studies have shown that the coupling between pelagic and benthic food webs in arctic aquatic environments is very important for the cycling of organic matter. It is also clear that the low productivity of most Arctic lakes forces the biota to a very efficient utilization of recourses and that prey-predator interactions work in a strong manner.\n\nRationale and goal. As clearly stated in the ACIA documents it is necessary to improve and the understanding of ecosystem structure, food web behaviour and productivity in Arctic ecosystems along geographical gradients in order to enables the best management practices and protection of such ecosystems for the future. This applies also to the freshwater systems that are essential components in the terrestrial biome as well as a connection between land and sea. The establishment of a strong circumpolar freshwater research network within the IPY is seen as way forward to facilitate the present and future understanding and thus preservation of these ecosystems.\nThe most significant advances within the framework of IPY will be to enforce the research, educational and communication relationships across countries and cultures in the Arctic region. By bringing researcher together that are expects in their fields and/or regions, the network will be able to provide a profound base of knowledge of physical, chemical and biological characteristics of lakes in the Arctic region. By including young scientist as well as training aspect this initiative foster a new generation of scientists that are prepared to take action in international decision and research communities. \nThe networking activities will also include joint expeditions that serve to exploit areas previously not studied because of logistic and/or resources reasons and to share technical and scientific skills between research teams that are not yet co-working. \n\nClustering. The network consists of an already established Nordic collaboration network that has wished to open up to become a multidisciplinary and -national networking unit that will aim at coordinate complementary research groups that are or will perform limnological research in the Arctic. The partner consortium is formed by unifying the original EoI#539, that was assigned by IPY to become a lead project by several other EoI´s that were relevant including two EoI (#313 and 429) that have formed their own clusters but have expressed wished to coordinate activities where it is possible.",

The processes leading to a calving event include the initiation and propagation of through-cutting rifts. Iceberg calving can result in a significant loss of mass from the Antarctic ice sheet, and represents ~ 65% of the total ice sheet ablation. Therefore, it is critical to understand the processes which precede and lead up to a major calving event in order to realistically assess how future climate changes might affect the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Post-calving, iceberg drift is influenced by the shape of the coastline, bottom topography, and a combination of tides, currents, wind, and sea ice. Monitoring the evolution of icebergs as they drift into warmer waters provides a valuable experiment in how rapid climate change influences ice shelves – especially such components as firn compaction, the impact of surface meltwater, ponding, and iceberg break-up. Grounded icebergs cause a severe devastation of the sea floor, forcing benthic communities to re-colonise. Iceberg melting and decay represents a significant source of freshwater (and mineral dust) primarily into the upper layers of the Southern Ocean's northern fringe. A stabilisation of the weakly stratified water column has important and poorly understood consequences for sea ice and water masses involved in deep and bottom water formation, and the biology of the euphotic zone.\n\nhttp://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=81",

Explorers Cove forams, which may normally have bathymetric ranges to >3,000 m, are ideal for field and laboratory experimentation, and serve as useful model systems for studying the ecology and evolution of deep-sea assemblages. \n\nJust as a firm understanding of the protists is vital to developing a clear picture of early eukaryotic evolution, the key to the origin of Foraminifera lies in the study of the early branching allogromiids. An improved understanding of the relationships between early forams through multigene based molecular phylogenies is a goal of this project. Additionally, a more careful study of the &crown allogromiids& will illuminate the evolutionary steps that lead to the rotaliids, which dominate many shallow-water temperate environments and pelagic foram assemblages.\n\nExtant protists represent the modern products of ancient predatory (phagotrophic) prokaryotes. Protists are well known as consumers of microbiota, but the consumption of metazoans by protists is not widely appreciated. As a result, the consequences of ancient predatory protists are rarely considered a major factor in the diversification of animals during the late Proterozoic/early Cambrian. This project will test hypothesis that predation on metazoans is widespread among basal forams, and if supported by analyses of the new protein-coding sequence data, then the role of these protists in Neoproterozoic ecosystems will need to be reevaluated.\n\nThe objectives of the research are to: test the validity of the foram phylogenetic hypotheses currently based solely on single gene sequence data; examine the ultrastructure of representative members of allogromiid clades; explore the origin of polar forams using the new molecular phylogenetic and structural data; further examine the trophic strategies of allogromiids; and to determine if carnivory is a fundamental nutritional mode for basal forams, or a special derived character. \n\nhttp://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0440769",

            "definition": "The MAPS experiment measures the global distribution of carbon monoxide (CO) in the free troposphere. Because of MAPS' previous flights on board the Space Shuttle, Earth system scientists now know that carbon monoxide concentrations in the troposphere are highly variable around the planet, and that widespread burning in the South American Amazon region and the African savannas are major global sources of carbon monoxide in the troposphere.\n      \nMAPS Hardware:\n      \nMAPS consists of an electro-optical sensor, an electronics module, a digital tape dsata record, and an aerial camera. The 92 kg MAPS package is 90 cm long, 76 cm wide, and 58 cm high. The hardware is coupled to a cold plate and mounted on the Multi-Purpose Experiment Support Structure (MPESS) which is installed at the forward end of the cargo bay.  The electro-optical sensor incorporates two gas cells, one containing 350 hPa of CO and another containing 149 hPa of N2O; their corresponding detectors; a direct radiation detector; and external balance and gain check system; and an internal balance system.\n      \nThe electronics module of MAPS consists of the signal processors, the balance system controls, and the circuitry required to operate the system. The space-qualified Lockheed Mark V tape recorder records the experiment data at an average rate of 43 bits per second. The Flight Research 35-mm aerial camera, equipped with a light sensor, photographs the groundtrack during sunlit portions of the orbit.\n      \nMAPS Operations:\n      \nWhen the Space Shuttle attains Earth-viewing position, the MAPS instrument pallet (shown in the lower right hand corner) power is supplied and the instrument is commanded on. After a 30-minute warmup, the instrument executes a balance cycle and gain check before it begins to take data. MAPS continues to operate throughout the Earth- observing period. Balance and gain check recur at 12-hour intervals or upon command from the Earth-based experiment team.  The three instrument signals (two difference channel signals and one direct radiometer signal) and various 'housekeeping' signals are digitized, formatted, and stored on the experiment's tape recorder. These signals are also telemetered to the ground via the Space Shuttle telemetry system. When the Payload Operations Control Center receives the telemetered signals, the MAPS operations team evaluates the instrument operation and processes the signals to provide 'quick look' carbon monoxide mixing ratios along the shuttle ground track.\n      \nThe aerial camera mounted next to the MAPS electro-optical head provides information on cloud cover and terrain over which the data are gathered. Operation of the camera and tape recorder can be inhibited during periods when the Shuttle is not in proper Earth-viewing attitude.\n      \nMAPS Investigators:\n      \nThe MAPS experiment is conducted by a team led by Principal\nInvestigator Henry G. Reichle, Jr. of NASA's Langley Research\nCenter. The MAPS science team, which advises the experiment team and\nassists in evaluation of MAPS data, consists of V.

By its nature, it is particular sensitive to climatic change. The last decennia of the 20th century have seen a rapid increase in mean temperatures, melting of glaciers, decrease of Arctic sea-ice coverage and thawing of permafrost areas. Continued warming will undoubtedly have strong consequences, not only for the arctic communities, but for the world as a whole. The climatic history of the past two millenia with a (warm) Roman Period, (cold) Dark Ages, (warm) Medieval Optimum, (cold) Little Ice Age and 20th Century Warming shows that rapid shifts in the natural climate regime have occurred repeatedly. There are strong indications that these climate trends are not uni-directional for the entire Arctic, but that they show regional patterns, e.g. the recent contrast between SW Greenland cooling and NW European warming. Previously, sea surface temperatures offshore SW Greenland had been relatively high during the 1950's and 1960's, when northwest European winters were generally more severe (e.g. 1962-63). Consequently, it is likely that for a given time interval patterns of human occupation and activities may also regionally have been different. prehistorical times, around 2000 years ago, the Dorset (Innuit) Culture was about to disappear in Greenland, whereas it took several centuries before a new Innuit culture immigrated. In a historical context it includes the period during which the Vikings settled on the Faroer, Iceland and Greenland and also travelled to Newfoundland. The second part of the last millennium were the heydays for dutch whaling expeditions. The latter implies that a wealth of historical data (ship's logbooks) on climatic and sea ice conditions are available.\n\nNotable is the shift of whaling activities from Spitsbergen to Davis Strait during the later part of the Little Ice Age, a well known cooling period in NW Europe.\n\nArctic archeology is about human adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Critical boundary conditions for human survival in the Arctic, such as duration of the summer season, permafrost conditions and the presence of sea-ice are often difficult to establish based on archeological evidence alone. Research has its specific logistic problems: short seasons, permafrost, ice/snow coverage, resulting in an often scattered and fragmented archeological record. To complete this record, a consistent chronological climatic/environmental context is needed. This can be supplied by paleoclimatological research, aiming to reconstruct climatic/environmental variability at high resolution. This is achieved by analysing sedimentological (grainsize, composition), chemical (geochemistry, stable oxygen and carbon isotopes) and biological (foraminifera, diatoms, molluscs) parameters from marine/terrestrial cores and environments taken in key areas.\n\nNORCLIM (IPY 120) is designed to provide constraints on pressing questions that address the nature of the 20th century Arctic warming. The proposal focusses on natural climate variability during the past 2000 years with special emphasis on the permafrost/sea-ice relation and on contrasting climatic trends (south)west off Greenland when compared with the NE Atlantic region.\n\nThe research is based on an integrated approach to reconstruct the changes in ocean surface currents, particularly the inflow of warm Atlantic water versus outflow of ice-loaded Polar water, terrestrial environments and evolution of glaciers and ice sheets in the study area. Evidence for climatic variability will be gathered from marine/terrestrial sedimentary records (multiproxy approach), molluscs, geomorphological and archeological evidence, and historical archives (e.g. whaling data).\n\nThe objectives of NORCLIM are:\n- To correlate existing marine/terrestrial paleoclimate records\n- To link existing marine/terrestrial paleoclimate records with archeological/historical information\n- To identify gaps in our knowledge for the various key-areas\n- To fill these gaps by collecting additional information onshore and offshore for all data sets\n- To place archeological and historical data in a solid climatological framework\n- To use the confirmed regional contrasts, if any, for improved regional climate prediction and societal/economic planning.",

            "definition": "READER (REference Antarctic Data for Environmental Research) is a project of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR http://www.scar.org/) and has the goal of creating a high quality, long term dataset of mean surface and upper air meteorological measurements from in-situ Antarctic observing systems. These data will be of value in climate research and climate change investigations.\n\nThe primary sources of data are the Antarctic research stations and automatic weather stations. Data from mobile platforms, such as ships and drifting buoys are not being collected since our goal is to derive time series of data at fixed locations.\n\nSurface and upper air data are being collected and the principal statistics derived are monthly and annual means. Daily data will not be provided in order to keep the data set to a manageable size. With the resources available to the project, it is clearly not possible to collect all the information that could be required by the whole range of investigations into change in the Antarctic. Instead a key set of meteorological variables (surface temperature, mean sea level pressure and surface wind speed, and upper air temperature, geopotential height and wind speed at standard levels) are being assembled and a definitive set of measurements presented for use by researchers.\n\nA lot of stations have been operated in the Antarctic over the years; many for quite short periods. However, our goal here is to provide information on the long time series that can provide insight into change in the Antarctic. So to be included, the record from a station must extend for 25 years, although not necessarily in a continuous period, or be currently in operation and have operated for the last 10 years. In READER we have chosen to use only data from year-round stations.\n\nIt is important when using mean data to know the number of observations that were used in computing the means. As discussed in the data section, the READER mean monthly values are therefore colour coded to indicate the percentage of possible observations used in computing each mean.\n\nThe READER data set is being disseminated via CD-ROM and through the World Wide Web at http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/programs-hosted.html. The first release of the data set covers the period up to the end of 2000 and contains all the data collected so far. However, there are still a number of significant gaps and it is hoped that these can be filled over the coming years. In particular, we still require more upper air data.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the READER website at http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/READER/",

            "definition": "A significant proportion of global primary production occurs in the coastal ocean where the biological pump exports carbon to deep water. The pump's efficiency depends on the fraction of carbon fixation that escapes recycling within the mixed layer, i.e. new production, which is supported by nutrient influx (e.g. nitrate or silicate) to the euphotic zone. Wind-driven coastal upwelling provides nutrient enrichment that creates high rates of new production in eastern boundary ocean margins, which will be described here using historical data collected by our group in a variety of upwelling areas. These include data from Peru, northwest Africa and Baja, California collected during the 1970's as part of the Coastal Upwelling Ecosystem Analysis (CUEA) Program, in the 1980's at Point Conception, CA during the Organization of Persistent Upwelling Structures (OPUS) Project, in the 1990's in Monterey Bay, CA and more recently off Bodega Bay California during the Coastal Ocean Processes Wind Events and Shelf Transport (CoOP-WEST) program. In all studies, the percent of new production or 'f ratio' was calculated using the same approach, from nitrate uptake measured using the stable isotopic tracer, 15N. A common feature in these systems, is the need for a brief window of relaxed winds (3-5 days) following an upwelling event, to enable new production rates to increase, as phytoplankton biomass accumulates. More recently, the importance of the larger sized fraction of phytoplankton (mainly diatoms) to new production in these ecosystems has been documented. The significance of this diatom dominance to carbon flux and sinking export within these productive coastal ecosystems will be discussed. \n\nhttp://74.125.95.104/search?q=cache:mHOLKkBiTjoJ:start.org/meetings/os06/os06-sessions/os06_OS32N.html+information+about+Observations+of+Persistent+Upwelling+Structures&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=9&gl=us&client=firefox-a",

            "definition": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:\n\nThe Marine EcoSystems Analysis (MESA) Puget Sound Project has\nundertaken intensive studies of Puget Sound, with particular\nemphasis on such highly industrialized areas as Elliott and\nCommencement Boys and Sinclair Inlet. These studies have\ninvolved chemical, biological and oceanographic investigations\naimed at determining the concentrations, fates and effects of\ntoxic chemicals in the Puget Sound ecosystem. An integral part\nof these studies has been toxicity tests with field-collected\nsediments. The present study was initiated to extend sediment\ntoxicity testing to two previously untested industrialized Puget\nSound embayments: Bellingham Bay and Everett Harbor. Relatively\nhigh concentrations of toxic chemicals had been reported from\nthese two areas (Malins et al., 1982).  The contaminant mixtures\ndiscovered there differed somewhat from those observed in other\nparts of Puget Sound. This study was initiated to determine if\nsediments from these two areas were toxic or not. Toxicity\ntesting was also conducted south of Bellingham Bay at Samish\nBay, chosen as a reference area.  A total of 22 stations were\nchosen for study: 10 in the Everett Harbor area, 10 in\nBellingham Bay, and 2 in Samish Bay. Composite sediment grab\nsamples were collected from each station and tested for acute\nlethal, sublethal, partial life-cycle, cell reproduction and\ngenotoxic effects. These effects were examined utilizing\nsensitive test methods applied elsewhere in Puget Sound (Chapman\net al., 1982a; in press a, b). An additional station south of\nEverett Harbor was tested (with negative results) for acute\nlethal and sublethal effects.  On the basis of acute lethal,\nsublethal, partial life-cycle, cell reproduction and genotoxic\neffects testing, Everett Harbor, Bellingham and Samish Bays were\nless toxic than contaminated areas such as the Duwamish Waterway\n(Elliott Bay) and the Commencement Bay Waterways. Everett Harbor\nsediments were more toxic overall than those from Bellingham\nBay. Samish Bay sediments only showed toxicity in cell\nreproduction and genotoxic tests, suggesting very different\nsediment chemistry in this area.  Partial life-cycle bioassays\nwith oyster larvae (Crassostrea gigas) were conducted by\nexposing fertilized eggs to settled sediment slurries for 48 h\nthen determining the number of live larvae and any\nabnormalities. A total of 19 stations demonstrated significant\nabnormalities or mortalities; the two reference stations showed\nno significant effects.  Acute lethal bioassays were conducted\nwith the sensitive amphipod Rhepoxynius abronius. Two stations\n(one each in Bellingham Bay and Everett-Harbor) demonstrated\nsignificant acute lethal effects; the two reference stations\nshowed no significant effects.  Sublethal effects measurements\nwere conducted with the oligochaete Monopylephorus cuticulatus\nby exposing the worms to sediment elutriates and measuring\nrespiration rates. Seven stations demonstrated significant\nrespiration rate differences compared to controls; the two\nreference stations showed no significant effects.  Cell\nreproduction studies were conducted by exposing rainbow trout\ngonad (RTG-2) and bluegill fry (BF-2) cells to sediment extracts\nduring logarithmic growth. Eight stations (including one\nreference station) significantly reduced cell growth in RTG-2\ncells, and three stations (including both reference stations)\nsignificantly reduced cell growth in BF-2 cells.  Genotoxic\ntests for chromosomal damage were conducted by exposing RTG-2\ncells to sediment extracts and determining mitotic (anaphase\naberration) effects.  Sediment extracts from eight stations\n(including one reference station) caused significant chromosomal\ndamage.  Physical and chemical data for tested samples (particle\nsize, total volatile solids, digestible organic carbon, and\nextractable organic matter) were within the ranges observed for\nother areas of Puget Sound with the following exceptions. A high\nclay content was noted in Bellingham Bay sediments and a high\npercentage of total volatile solids was noted in inner Everett\nHarbor sediments.\n\nINTRODUCTION:\n\nOne of the intents of the MESA Puget Sound Project is to develop\nan understanding of the effects of environmental contaminants upon\nPuget Sound biota. High environmental levels of particular\nchemicals have been detected in sediments from industrialized\nembayments of Puget Sound, and a variety of in situ biological\neffects (e.g. tissue abnormalities in fish and shellfish, changes in\nbiological community structure) occur in areas associated with high\nlevels of various contaminants (Malins et al., 1980, 1982; Dexter et\nal., 1981; Long, 1982). Direct evidence of toxicity from Puget Sound\nsediments has recently been provided for three of these industrialized\nembayments: Elliott Bay, Commencement Bay and Sinclair Inlet\n(Chapman et al., 1982a, in press a, b).\nContaminant mixtures found in sediments from Bellingham Bay and\nEverett Harbor were known to differ from those of the previously\ntested areas. However, the relative toxicity of sediments in these\ntwo areas was unknown. Recent indirect evidence of the potential\nfor biological effects among biota captured in the two areas\nhas been collected.\nField studies have recently recorded fin rot and lesions in bottom\nfish in Bellingham Bay and Everett Harbor (Campana, 1983;\nGronlund et al., 1983). The intent of the present study was to\ndetermine whether marine sediments from these embayments also\nexhibited toxic biological effects in direct exposure tests.\nAccordingly, composited sediment grab samples were obtained from a\ntotal of 22 stations (including a non-industrialized reference area,\nSamish Bay). These samples were tested for possible biological\neffects using a range of species and test methodologies. Sediment\ncollected from a station in Possession Sound, south of Everett\nHarbor, was also tested on an opportunistic basis. The results were\nused to determine the relative toxicity of Everett Harbor and\nBellingham Bay samples compared to those from other tested areas\nof Puget Sound.",

            "definition": "The National Status and Trends (NS&T) program monitors the spatial\ndistributions, temporal trends and biological effects of chemical pollutants\nin estuarine and coastal marine areas of the  United States.  The program was\ndesigned to help determine the present conditions of the Nation's coastal\nmarine environment, and establish whether these conditions are improving or\ndeclining.  To accomplish this, the program annually measures the\nconcentrations of selected contaminants in marine biota and sediments,\ncollected from coastal areas around the country.  The relationship between\ncontaminant exposure and indicators of biological responses in marine\norganisms is also examined.  Policy makers and resource managers may use NS&T\ndata to help assess the effects of human activities on the coastal marine\nenvironment and to indicate areas where pollution control measures are working\nor might be needed.\nThe NS&T program is administered by ORCA's Coastal Monitoring and Bioeffects\nDivision (CMBAD), in conjunction with NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service\n(NMFS) and the Office of NOAA Corps Operations; ORCA is a major line office of\nthe National Ocean Service (NOS) within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA).  Some components of the NS&T program are conducted\nthrough cooperative agreements with state and regional environmental monitoring\nprograms.\nThe primary emphasis of the NS&T program is the determination of the status\nand effects of toxic chemicals in coastal marine and estuarine areas.  Through\nits Mussel Watch Project, the program monitors the levels of over 70\ncontaminants in sediments and the soft tissue of mussels and oysters.  The\nprogram's Benthic Surveillance Project monitors the same suite of chemicals in\nsediments and benthic (bottom-dwelling) fish, and additionally analyzes fish\nfor disease conditions and specific physiological responses that are\nassociated with contaminant exposure.  The chemicals selected by the NS&T\nprogram serve as indicators of human activity and, at certain levels, may be\nacutely or chronically toxic to marine life.  Monitored contaminants include\n24 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); 20 congeners of polychlorinated\nbiphenyls (PCBs); 15 chlorinated pesticides, including Chlordane and DDT (and\nbreakdown elements of DDT); butyltins; four major elements; and 12 trace\nelements.  Sediments also are analyzed for total organic carbon content (TOC),\nand for spore concentrations of the bacterium Clostridium perfringens, which\nis associated with sewage contamination.  The grain size distribution among\nsediment particles also is recorded to account for differences among\ncontaminant levels, due to differing capacities for sediments to accumulate\ncontaminants.\nThe NS&T program also conducts Bioeffects Surveys, and prepares Historical\nTrends reports and Coastal Contamination Assessments in selected coastal\nareas.  Bioeffects Surveys provide information on the magnitude and extent of\ncontaminant-associated effects by measuring such properties as external and\ninternal disease, reproductive impairment and genetic damage in fish and\nbivalves, and sediment toxicity resulting from contaminants.  Historical\nTrends reports identify patterns of contamination in selected coastal areas\nover extended periods of time.  These studies compare new NS&T data with\npertinent historical data, including chemical analyses of of sediment core\nsegments.  Coastal Contamination Assessments combine contaminant findings with\nsuch estuarine-related information as hydrologic features, point source\ncharacteristics, and projected population trends to provide comprehensive\nenvironmental assessments of selected coastal areas.\nThe NS&T program concentrates on estuaries, bays, and near-shore marine areas.\nThrough the program's Mussel Watch and Benthic Surveillance projects, samples\nare collected at regular intervals from over 300 sites throughout the United\nStates, including Alaska and Hawaii.  Monitoring activities are designed to\ndescribe national and regional distributions of contamination.  Sampling sites\ngenerally are located between 10 and 100 kilometers apart.  Sites are selected\nto represent contaminant levels in the surrounding area and to avoid\nsmall-scale patches of contamination, or 'hot spots'.  Conversely, Bioeffects\nSurveys are performed in areas where NS&T monitoring projects indicate high\nchemical pollutant levels.  These surveys are conducted primarily in urban\nembayment areas, such as Boston Harbor, Tampa Bay, and the Southern California\nBight.  Coastal Contamination Assessments are directed toward estuaries and\nembayments such as the Long Island Sound, and larger regions, such the Gulf of\nMaine.  Sediment core samples for NS&T's Historical Trends studies also are\ncollected from selected estuaries and embayments.\nThe NS&T program was initiated in 1984.  A primary objective of the program is\nto determine the current status and distribution through time of chemical\npollutants.  To accomplish this, samples are collected from most NS&T\nmonitoring sites on an annual basis.  Presently, the NS&T monitoring data base\ncontains data on contaminant concentrations in fish livers collected from 1984\nto 1988, and in molluscan tissues collected from 1986 to 1990.  The data base\nalso contains data on contaminant concentrations in sediments from selected\nsites collected from 1984 to the present.  Recent trends in contamination may\nbe inferred by comparing NS&T data with relevant historical data, derived from\nother sources.  Data from NS&T core sample analyses will allow the\ndetermination of contaminant trends since pre-industrial times.  Since 1986,\nthe NS&T program has conducted biological effects surveys, ranging from two to\nfour years in duration.\nQuality Assurance is a major component of the NS&T program, as it is necessary\nthat the analytical data generated by participating laboratories be consistent\nand of known quality.  Analytical procedures adhere to the standard procedures\nof the NS&T Quality Assurance (QA) Project, established for all laboratories\nparticipating in the NS&T program.  As part of the QA Project, laboratories\nassociated with the NS&T program participate in yearly intercomparison\nexercises administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST), and the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada.  The NS&T program\nalso administers a 'specimen bank' of samples for the purpose of retrospective\nanalyses.  Samples are  collected from selected NS&T monitoring sites,\npreserved in liquid nitrogen and stored  at -150 C at the NIST facility in\nGaithersburg, Maryland.\nNS&T data are available in a variety of reports and publications (over 400 to\ndate).  Raw data from the Benthic Surveillance Project (1984- 88) and Mussel\nWatch Project (1986-90) are available upon request in microfiche format and on\n3.5' PC and Macintosh computer diskettes.  In conjunction with ORCA's\nStrategic Environmental Assessment Division (SEA), the NS&T program is\ndeveloping a desk-top database information and display system that will allow\nthe portrayal of spatial distributions and temporal trends of contamination in\nthe coastal marine environment.  Software has been developed for examining,\ndisplaying, and mapping environmental and natural resource information on\nhigh-resolution base maps.  Using Macintosh-related software, NS&T data will\nbe expressed in graph form and on high- resolution base maps.\nPoint of contact:\nAndrew Robertson\nThe National Status and Trends Program\nCoastal Monitoring and Bioeffects Assessment Division\nOffice of Ocean Resources Conservation and Assessment\n6001 Executive Blvd; Rm. 312\nRockville, MD  20852\n(301) 443-8933\nSelected NS&T projects also are supported by a number of programs administered\nby ORCA's Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Division, including the\nNational Coastal Pollutant Discharge Inventory (NCPDI), the National Estuarine\nInventory (NEI), and the National Shellfish Register.",

However, serving on, and interacting with, the NACP science steering group, as well as the ad-hoc group on Remote Sensing for NACP and the task force to coordinate NACPs mid-continent intensive campaign has made it clear that NASAs Earth Observing System (EOS) data products are not being used to their full potential within NACP. \n\nThe solution:\n \nNASAs Goddard Space Flight Center is operationally producing global product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This is done within the MODIS Adaptive Processing System (MODAPS). The related software operates on a cluster of multimission processing systems supporting several research teams. Two recent extensions of MODAPS, which were developed for archive and distribution of MODIS products, are the Atmospheres Archive and Distribution System (AADS) and the Land Archive and Distribution System (LADS). AADS and LADS offer new opportunities for custom processing and distribution of MODIS products. The goal of this proposal is to leverage, extend, and tailor the functionality available through AADS and LADS to serve the remote sensing needs of the North American Carbon Program as a: Data and Information Systems Support for Science Focus Areas and Applications. The purpose of these enhancements is to streamline access to MODIS atmosphere and land data products, to reduce data volume by providing only those data required by the user, and to improve the utility of data products. The proposed work will provide NACP investigators with a time series of MODIS products and custom preprocessing that will allow for direct ingest into an investigators modeling framework. By reducing the burden associated with ordering and pre-processing of MODIS products, we will enable NACP investigator to focus on the information content in MODIS data and its contribution to understanding carbon budgets. \n\nAnticipated Benefits:\n \nThis proposal will serve key researchers within the NACP who have an urgent need for enhanced support of MODIS data. The needs of this group will be representative of the larger climate modeling community and other land and atmosphere researchers; and the tools developed.",

MCM joined the National Science Foundation's LTER Network in 1993 and is funded through the Office of Polar Programs in six year funding periods. \n\nThe McMurdo Dry Valleys are located on the western coast of McMurdo Sound (77°00'S 162°52'E) and form the largest relatively ice-free area (approximately 4800 square kilometers) on the Antarctic continent. These ice-free areas of Antarctica display a sharp contrast to most other ecosystems in the world, which exist under far more moderate environmental conditions. The perennially ice-covered lakes, ephemeral streams and extensive areas of exposed soil within the McMurdo Dry Valleys are subject to low temperatures, limited precipitation and salt accumulation. Thus, the dry valleys represent a region where life approaches its environmental limits, and is an 'end-member' in the spectrum of environments included in the LTER Network. The dry valleys, unlike most other ecosystems, are dominated by microorganisms, mosses, lichens, and relatively few groups of invertebrates; higher forms of life are virtually non-existent. The original objectives of the McMurdo LTER were to understand the influence of physical and biological constraints on the structure and function of dry valley ecosystems and to understand the modifying effects of material transport on these ecosystems. Now in the third funding cycle, we are poised to answer more complex questions about biodiversity, the impact of climatic legacies, and ecosystem structure and function. \n\nAreas of research covered are meteorology, glaciology, streams, limnology and soil ecology.\n\nhttp://www.mcmlter.org/index.html",

And, as missions become progressively more daring, and thus more difficult, more advanced capabilities are needed. However, before new, untried technologies are used for the first time on complex exploration missions, engineers and scientists want to make sure they will operate well, and safely, in the hazardous environment of space. \n\nTo accomplish this, NASA's Office of Space Science (OSS) and Office of Earth Science jointly established the New Millennium Program (NMP) in 1995 - an ambitious, exciting vision to speed up space exploration through the development and testing of leading-edge technologies. A unique program, managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology, NMP provides a critical bridge from initial concept to exploration-mission use. Through NMP, selected technologies are demonstrated in the 'laboratory' of space that can't be replicated on Earth.\n\nSince its inception over a decade ago, NMP has validated many innovative technologies for both Earth science and space science missions. Now funded and managed solely out of NASA's newly formed Science Mission Directorate (SMD), the Program continues to demonstrate advanced technologies that will enable space science missions of the 21st century with significant (a several-generation leap) technical capabilities.\n\nHighly advanced technologies are key to more capable, powerful, and efficient spacecraft and science instruments.

The primary focus of observation is the human-Rangifer link under current impact of socio-economic and climate change. Establishing a mobile observation facility (nomadic camp) offers the best possibilities for long-term observation in the natural environment of the tundra. Thus, researchers use the same practice of following herds that most Rangifer users themselves have used for centuries. The trajectory of the mobile station is determined by the annual migration of a chosen Rangifer herd. The data is recorded in a standardized form, dealing with impact/response description related to socio-economic and climate change, respectively. This data is transmitted from the field on a web-site of the project at regular sessions. After completion of the first migration in the centre of the Kola Peninsula (NW Russia), the station shall be made available to other researchers of the human-Rangifer link. Every effort shall be made to continue the work of the station on a longitudinal basis, inviting the cooperation of interested sub-arctic oriented institutions.\nFollow-up activities envisage a potential network of monitoring stations in the Eurasian sub-arctic zone.

These rapid changes are in sharp contrast to relatively slow variations in surface elevation in the interior, which have been tied to accumulation and firn compaction variations on a decadal timescale. The challenge of documenting and attempting to understand the processes involved has motivated a large collection of proposed research projects aimed at this problem. These range from expansions of ongoing efforts to new projects, and from individual investigators to consortia from a number of nations. They utilize a range of observational and modeling techniques and exploit evolving capabilities in atmospheric modeling, remote sensing for measurement of ice motion and surface conditions, and surface-based and aircraft-based measurement techniques. \n\nTo maximize the efficacy of efforts, an effective and timely dialog between these diverse projects is required. This dialog must encompass discussion of planned research, including field campaigns and modeling studies, interactions among field parties where practical, and rigorous discussion of results. To communicate effectively our emerging understanding, it would be of great benefit to maintain a current discussion of the collective state of the research in a common location. We believe that this new concentration of efforts focused on the downstream end of the mass balance problem in Greenland by investigators from many nations meshes well with the goals of the IPY, and forms a natural core IPY activity in Greenland.\n\nWork associated with this cluster is diverse, but the value of coordination at the international level is clear. Examples of activities that will benefit include: fieldwork that involves at least two projects from different nations using lidar and satellite measurements to track surface height change; numerous field and remote-sensing based studies of ice flow variations and patterns of surface melting; at least two projects that will use atmospheric models to estimate surface energy and mass balance; and a number of studies will exploit different approaches to ice flow modelling to interpret observations. A common goal in these studies is the documentation and understanding of ice sheet marginal change in Greenland.\n\nThis proposal for a core activity for the IPY is aimed at facilitation of communication and collaboration among an open group of consortium members, with the goal of enhancing coordination of field measurement campaigns, modeling studies, and remote sensing measurements dedicated to understanding surface conditions and ice discharge in Greenland. The intent is to use the umbrella of the IPY to lower barriers to international interaction and cooperation between projects at all scales. The improved connectivity is intended to begin at the start of projects, to have an impact on planning and measurement strategies, and continue through data analysis and into special sessions at international meetings and include integrative topical meetings specific to Greenland. \n\nIn this cluster proposal we identify a number of projects that have just received notification of funding for research that will continue through the IPY time period, projects that have submitted full proposals for funding to national funding agencies, and projects that are still in their formative stages. The suite of projects included here provides the beginning of a roster that can grow through the IPY period. All consortium members will adhere to National and ICSU requirements for IPY data policies, and utilize available resources for outreach coordination. Most activities directly involve students, and will be actively involved in training the next generation of polar scientists.",

In this project, we propose to measure and model delta O18 and Lead-210 vertical profiles (together with internal temperature and salinity) to study\nheat and brine fluxes through sea ice; two processes that are crucial for a better understanding of ice growth and melt dynamics. A unique aspect of the proposed work is that we will incorporate tracer\ntransport and fractionation into models of sea ice growth and melt. Towards this end, we propose to collect ice cores during the overwintering of the Amundsen ice breaker (Flaw Lead Polynya project), and to measure vertical profiles of temperature salinity, delta O18, and Lead-210 within each core. Tracer transport capabilities will be added to current dynamically and thermodynamically rigorous models of sea ice evolution. The modelled tracer profiles will then be used to reconstruct delta O18 values of the surface ocean along the past trajectory of the sea floe, and potential pollutant transport pathways within the Arctic Ocean. This proposal directly addresses the following major International Polar Year (IPY) objectives: (1) to advance our understanding of polar-global interactions by studying tele-connections on all scales, (2) to quantify, and understand, past and present environmental and human change in the polar regions in order to improve predictions, (3) to determine the present environmental status of the polar regions by quantifying their spatial and temporal variability, (4) to investigate the unknowns at the frontiers of science in the polar regions.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=322",

The international character of the project and its target zone are reflected in the work nagisa, which is Japanese for the narrow coastal zone where the land meets the sea. NaGISA holds a unique position in the Census of Marine Life as an ambassador project, linking CoML to local interests around the world. NaGISA's first aim is to draw up an global baseline of biodiversity and then to use the network organized in that effort to continue monitoring those same shores for the next 50 years.\n\nMethods and Technology\nNaGISA used both passive and active sampling to assess quantitative/qualitative ecological/taxonomic information from the near shore zone. Employing a simple, cost-efficient and intentionally low-tech sampling protocol NaGISA will fulfill the goal of a series of well-distributed standard transects from the high intertidal zone to 20 meters water depth around the world by 2009. This is possible as the protocols are widely adaptable and have been adopted by research groups in many different countries (although new participants are always welcome!). The simple design of the protocols and unique nested hierarchy allows not only local community involvement but satisfies the technical/statistical needs of a global census.\n\nNaGISA targets two specific habitats, rocky bottom macroalgal communities and soft bottom seagrass communities. Both complex globally occurring ecosystems that are currently far less well characterized than they should be. At each NaGISA study site, replicate samples are collected at the high, mid and low intertidal and at 1, 5 and 10m subtidal zones (15 and 20m are done whenever possible). There are two levels of target sampling -- both include measurement of surface and bottom seawater temperature and a visual classification of substrata.\n\n    * 1. Non-invasive sampling using photography and observational techniques, percent cover estimates of colonial invertebrates and rhizoidal macroalgae and counts of algal stipes and solitary fauna within quadrats.\n    * 2. Invasive sampling, or direct removal, consists of core samples taken within sea grass beds, and careful and complete removal of all organisms (macro and meio) from small quadrats within macroalgal sites.\n\n\nSummary provided by http://www.nagisa.coml.org/",

Barrow, Alaska and Fort Chimo in the Ungava District (now northern Quebec). Together, John Murdoch's Ethnological Results of the Point Barrow Expedition (1892) and Turner's Ethnology of the Ungava District (1894) form the intellectual bedrock of northern native studies in their respected regions. These publications are likely the only research results from the original IPY which still are consulted routinely by researchers. The volumes have limitations as ethnological studies; they provide a comprehensive and valuable review of the material culture of Barrow's Inupiat residents and the Inuit and Innu of the Quebec-Labrador peninsula at the time of the first IPY. Both books are highly regarded by contemporary northern native community members across Alaska's North Slope and throughout the Eastern Canadian Arctic. \nWe propose a modern version of these ethnological collecting projects. Using the categories developed by Murdoch and Turner, with a few additions (e.g. communications equipment, navigation devices), the project will document modern equivalents of the items Murdoch collected, how they are manufactured or obtained, and their uses. Photographic (digital) and written documentation will require modest expenditures. \nIt is possible that much of the documentation can be accomplished as part of the school curriculum, involving students with Elders, or as part of a summer/after school program. It could also provide excellent material for science fair projects. A number of educators have expressed interest in incorporating the data collection process into broader educational endeavours. This idea builds on an existing exchange program between a Barrow, Alaska classroom, and in one in Munich, Germany. The idea can be used by any two classes or schools (at least one Northern), and we are planning to facilitate the finding of partners and exchange of ideas through the website. The idea is that two groups of children will be writing about themselves (including the material culture of their community) and asking about their partners. On one hand this will make them aware about their own culture and the differences of the other, and on the other hand it will open their minds to respect people of the other culture. So we will have junior ethnologists exploring the others on their own level. In the Barrow/Munich collaboration, the plans are for a focus on Alaska in English and Geography classes in Munich for several months, culminating in a presentation for parents. The materials exchanged would then be analyzed by older students (12 & 13th year) under the supervision of an ethnologist, ultimately leading to a book from children to children on the two cultures. While we do not expect most school pairs to go this far, the general idea can be used at a more limited scale by individual teachers. \nIf there is interest on the part of a museum (The Anchorage Museum or the Smithsonian Institution where the original IPY collections are held) and funding is obtained for conservation and curation costs, then in addition to documentation, the project could collect examples of reasonably sized items (i.e. no airplanes or front-end loaders), with a view to an exhibition on technology, then and now. This exhibit would be designed so that at least part of it could travel widely, including to Northern communities. Small teaching collections for classroom use will be obtained.\nThe project also will attempt to duplicate photographs, ethnographic and otherwise, taken by the 1st IPY expedition in the Barrow area and in Kujjuaqq (and at other IPY stations if there is interest). Sturm and his colleagues (2001), as well as many others, have demonstrated that comparative analyses of photographs taken at the same locations over periods of generations are productive in assessing long-term landscape changes.",

The extraordinary tusk defies most of the principles and properties of teeth and remains a scientific enigma. Findings about its form and function will add to the evolutionary knowledge for this odd adaptation and will, because of unique findings of anatomy and histology recently discovered by this team, further define sensory capabilities of mammalian teeth. Scientific results have already begun to direct interest in future models of dental material design as the hard tissue of the narwhal tusk possesses a combination of unusual flexibility and strength characteristics that is highly desirable in restorative materials. These same tusk traits were observed by the Inuit before the laboratory testing was completed, and the results were reported. Likewise, traditional knowledge elucidates many aspects of narwhal anatomy, function, migration and social behavior. Both the knowledge of Inuit elders and the findings of scientists are needed for a more complete understanding of the narwhal, Qilalugaq qernertaq. \n\nScientific studies in anatomy, morphology, histology, physiology, genetics, cellular biology and narwhal social behavior are currently being conducted by the principal investigator and collaborators to elucidate tusk function. Anatomical variations of narwhal will be described from field and laboratory dissection, computerized scans (CT, MRI and micro-CT), analysis of museum specimens, and interviews with Inuit elders. Photographic morpho-metric analysis of narwhal skeletal collections at the Museum of Nature in Canada, Zoological Museum, University of Copenhagen, the Smithsonian Institution and the American Museum of Natural History has been initiated, and we are seeking other institutions that may have additional collections, particularly those with rare specimens. Anatomic plates of narwhal anatomy will be completed based on all these collected findings. \n\nOn October 28, 2006, a panel discussion was presented by the principal investigator, Paniloo Sangoya and David Angnatsiak from the community of Pond Inlet at the 15th International Inuit Studies Conference in Paris, France.

            "definition": "A six year program, with a budget of $6 million, was undertaken by the Office of Sea Grant in 1976 to develop improved engineering predictive models for transport of sediment in and near the surf zone by waves and currents. The project, called the Nearshore Sediment Transport Study, has involved ten investigators from six different institutions who worked cooperatively on field studies. Three major field experiments have been conducted, the first in 1978, the second in 1980, and the last in 1981. The first two field experiments had a duratioon of approximately a month and involved synoptic measurements of more than 100 parameters of surf zone dynamics and sediment response. Sand tracer experiments were also performed and the last two field sites include concurrent trap experiments for longshore transport. All data were recorded on magnetic tape and more than a billion words were obtained in the second experiment. In the final two years of the project, emphasis has been placed on the formation of predictive models and their verification using the NSTS data sets.\n\nInformation provided by http://www.pubs.asce.org/WWWdisplay.cgi?8300240",

The ground motion coming\nfrom a particular magnitude and distance is assigned an annual\nprobability equal to the annual probability of occurrence of the\ncausative magnitude and distance.\n\nThe method assumes a reasonable future catalog of earthquakes,\nbased upon historical earthquake locations and geological\ninformation on the recurrence rate of fault ruptures.\n\nWhen all the possible earthquakes and magnitudes have been\nconsidered, one can find a ground motion value such that the\nannual rate of its being exceeded has a certain value. Hence, on\na given map, for a given probability of exceedance, PE,\nlocations shaken more frequently, will have larger ground\nmotions.\n\nFor a LARGE exceedance probability, the map will show the\nrelatively likely ground motions, which are LOW ground motions,\nbecause small magnitude earthquakes are much more likely to\noccur than are large magnitude earthquakes. For a SMALL\nexceedance probability, the map will emphasize the effect of\nless likely events: larger-magnitude and/or closer-distance\nevents, producing overall LARGE ground motions on the map.\n\nThe maps have this format, because they are designed to be\nuseful in building codes, in which we assume that, for the most\npart, all buildings would be built to the same level of\nsafety. For other applications, maps of another format might be\nmore useful.\n\nFor instance, many buildings across the US are built more or\nless the same, regardless of earthquake hazard. If we knew that\na particular type of building was likely to fail at a particular\nground motion level, we could make a map showing contours of the\nlikelihood of that ground motion value being exceeded, due to\nearthquakes.\n\nFor more information,\nlink to 'http://geohazards.cr.usgs.gov/eq/'",

To address\nthese central scientific issues, the Max '91 observing program utilizes\nadvanced instrumentation on spacecraft, rockets, and balloons, and at\nground-based observatories.  It  covers the electromagnetic spectrum from\nradio through optical to X-rays and gamma-rays, and includes measurements of\nneutrons and charged particles in interplanetary space.  Max '91 is designed\nto make major advances in solar flare physics through observations of high\nenergy flare phenomena and of the magnetic and thermal context in which they\ntake place. This will be achieved using recent advances in instrumentation\ntechnology that now make it possible, for the first time, to observe several\nof the most important processes on their intrinsic spatial, spectral and\ntemporal scales.\n     The core space missions for Max '91 will be the Japanese Yohkoh\nspacecraft, the Gamma Ray Observatory, and the spacecraft of the Global\nGeospace Studies program, particularly WIND and CLUSTER. Instruments on\nrockets will provide high-resolution images and spectra in the UV, EUV, and\nsoft X-rays during the preflare and thermal phases.\n     In addition to these space observations, NASA has a program of flights\nof advanced hard X-ray and gamma-ray instrumentation capable of making many\ntypes of observations not possible from these spacecraft or rockets. The\nNASA Max '91 Solar Balloon Program consisted of long-duration balloon\nflights in the Antarctic.  The Berkeley Hard X-Ray and Gammay Ray\nSpectrometer with Robert Lin as Primary Investigator obtained balloon data\nduring the December 1990 campaign.\n     Since MAX'91 is part of the FLARES 22 international campaign, many\nground-based observatories around the world has participated in monitoring\nthe Sun during the MAX-91 campaign periods.\nProject Description:\n    Max '91 is a program of flare research to observe the sun during the\n1991 solar maximum in several campaigns from instruments around the world\nand in space.  The following observing campaigns have been successfully\ncompleted:\n  SMM, VLA, and Collaborative Observations\n    1990, June 16 - July 2\n  Energetic Solar Phenomena  1990\n    1990, December 20 - 1991, January 13\n  Target-of-Opportunity Campaign to Observe Active Region 6659\n    1991, June 6-17\n  Gamma-Ray, Hard X-Ray, and Neutron Studies of Solar Flares\n    1991, October 3-17\n  Multiwavelength/Multispacecraft Observations of Solar Flares\n    1992, January 6-24\nWorkshops have been held discussing campaign results, and their proceedings\nare available from the program office on request.\n     The campaigns have been in a spirit of collaboration by scientists from\nall continents and featured the coordinated use of ground based telescopes\nin various spectral bands, and instruments on various spacecraft. The data\nare held by the individual investigators. The Max '91 campaign distributes\nbrief descriptions of the participating instruments, coverage, and the names\nand addresses of the investigators to contact.\n     The Max '91 program office organizes the campaigns and subsequent\nmeetings, provides support in the form of exchange of campaign information\nbefore, during and after the campaign, and fosters development of new\ninstrumentation.  After the campaign phase, which lasts from 1991-1994, a\nthree to four year phase of data analyses and interpretation will be part of\nthe Max '91 program.  The Max '91 Program is an integral part of the\ninternational FLARES 22 program so that the maximum scientific return can be\nobtained with the limited available resources.  Information is distributed\nvia electronic mail, electronic file transfers on SPAN and INTERNET, IUWDS\nUrsigram - GEOALERTS, electronic bulletin board service, TELEX and FAX.\nDuring the campaign daily Campaign Action notices are directly transmitted\nto the participants.  In addition, Max '91 workshops are held yearly.\n     Several specific research programs are sponsored in the USA by NSF and\nNASA in the framework of this campaign.

The polar-orbiting spacecraft consisted of three major structures: (1) a hollow torus-shaped sensor mount, (2) solar paddles, and (3) a control housing unit that was connected to the sensor mount by a tripod truss structure. Configured somewhat like an ocean buoy, Nimbus 7 was nearly 3.04 m tall, 1.52 m in diameter at the base, and about 3.96 m wide with solar paddles extended. The sensor mount that formed the satellite base housed the electronics equipment and battery modules. The lower surface of the torus provided mounting space for sensors and antennas. A box-beam structure mounted within the center of the torus provided support for the larger sensor experiments. Mounted on the control housing unit, which was located on top of the spacecraft, were sun sensors, horizon scanners, and a command antenna. The spacecraft spin axis was pointed at the earth. An advanced attitude-control system permitted the spacecraft's orientation to be controlled to within plus or minus 1 deg in all three axes (pitch, roll, and yaw). Eight experiments were selected: (1) limb infrared monitoring of the stratosphere (LIMS), (2) stratospheric and mesopheric sounder (SAMS), (3) coastal-zone color scanner (CZCS), (4) stratospheric aerosol measurement II (SAM II), (5) earth radiation budget (ERB), (6) scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR), (7) solar backscatter UV and total ozone mapping spectrometer (SBUV/TOMS), and (8) temperature-humidity infrared radiometer (THIR). These sensors were capable of observing several parameters at and below the mesospheric levels. More details can be found in 'The Nimbus 7 Users' Guide' (TRF B30045) and 'Nimbus-7 Data Product Summary' (NASA RP-1215), available from NSSDC.",

There are many different types of MPAs in U.S. waters.  Varying Definitions of MPAs Different Types and Characteristics of MPAs Working Definition for the MPA Inventory References\n\nVarying Definitions of MPAs\n\nThe term 'marine protected area' has been in use for over two decades. The concept of marine protected areas has been around for centuries. A marine protected area has come to mean different things to different people, based primarily on the level of protection provided by the MPA. Some see MPAs as sheltered or reserved areas where little, if any, use or human disturbance should be permitted. Others see them as specially managed areas designed to enhance ocean use. Many accept the definition developed by the World Conservation Union: 'any area of the intertidal or subtidal terrain, together with its overlying water and associated flora, fauna, historical and cultural features, which has been reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed environment' (IUCN, 1988; Kelleher, 1999).  Not too different is the definition in Marine Protected Areas Executive Order 13158. This defines an MPA as 'any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by Federal, State, territorial, tribal or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cultural resources therein' (Federal Register, 2000). Under this broad definition, a wide variety of sites could be considered as MPAs. \n\nThere are many different types of MPAs in the United States. For example, U.S. MPAs may include national marine sanctuaries, fishery management zones, national seashores, national parks, national monuments, critical habitats, national wildlife refuges, national estuarine research reserves, state conservation areas, state reserves, and many others. MPAs have different shapes, sizes, and management characteristics, and have been established for different purposes. \n\nMPAs provide different levels of protection and use. They range from areas closed to public access, such as Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Key Largo, Florida (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2001); to sites that permit access but do not allow consumptive uses, such as Edmonds Underwater Park in Washington (Murray,1998); to areas where the use of specific types of fishing gear is restricted, such as certain fishery management areas; and to multiple-use areas, such as the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (National Ocean Service (a), 2000).\n\nMPAs also protect a variety of specific natural and cultural resources. The near-shore Bristol Bay fishery closure area off Alaska protects king crab aggregations and habitat important to this valuable fisheries species (Code of Federal Regulations, 2000). The Virgin Islands National Park protects coral reef habitat and sea-turtle nesting areas (National Park Service, 1998). Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge protects habitat for endangered species such as the Hawaiian monk seal, coral reefs, and historical artifacts from the famous World War II battle that occurred there (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2001). The Monitor National Marine Sanctuary off the coast of North Carolina protects the site of this famous Civil War-era shipwreck (National Ocean Service (b), 2000).\n\nMPAs can range dramatically in size and shape. There are small areas, such as the 14-acre Farnsworth Bank Ecological Reserve in Los Angeles County, California (McArdle, 1997), and large areas, such as the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary in California, which covers 5,300 square miles (National Ocean Service (c), 2000).\n\nMPAs differ in location and jurisdiction. Some MPAs are in federal waters only, which, for the most part, extend from three to 200 miles offshore. These are managed under federal laws by federal agencies. Some MPAs are found only in state waters where both state and federal laws may apply. MPAs may overlap. The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park share jurisdiction over some ocean waters (National Academy of Public Administration, 2000). Finally, some MPAs, such as the Cape Cod National Seashore in Massachusetts, include both marine and land components (Bauman et al., 1998).\n\nFor more information: http://mpa.gov/\n\n[Summary provided by MPA]",

Hence, the need for\na multi-year seafloor observatory.\n\nThe site chosen for this observatory effort is called 'Axial\nSeamount'. Axial is an active volcano located on the Juan de Fuca\nRidge, about 250 miles off the coast of Oregon and Washington. The\nJuan de Fuca Ridge is a boundary where two of the Earth's tectonic\nplates move slowly, but episodically, apart. When the plates move, the\nprocess is accompanied by small earthquakes and, at some times, by\nmagma intrusions and volcanic eruptions.Axial volcano is seamount at\n460N, 1300W, at the intersection of the Juan de Fuca Ridge and the\nCobb seamount chain. It rises 1100 m above the surrounding ocean floor\nto a minimum depth of 1400 m below sea level. The Axial volcano was\nchosen for the NeMO Project because it is the most volcanically active\nsite on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.\n\nThe NeMO Project also is an opportunity to share this exciting\nscientific research with teachers, students, and the general\npublic.

These projects and associated data\nholdings are described elsewhere in this report.\nThe National Estuarine Inventory is a series of inter-related activities that\ndefine, characterize, and assess the Nation's estuarine systems.  The goal of\nthe NEI  is to develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating the health and\nstatus of the  Nation's estuaries and to bring estuaries into focus as a\nnational resource base.  NEI  data are compiled in a systematic and consistent\nmanner that enables the Nation's  estuaries to be compared and assessed\naccording to their environmental quality,  economic values, and resource uses.\nThe main holdings of the NEI project are described by the data set entries\nkeyed to Campaign/Project NEI. This is supplemented by the following summaries\nof four databases:\no Physical and Hydrologic Characteristics of Estuaries\no Estuarine Land-Use Categories\no Susceptibility of Estuaries to Nutrient Related Pollution\no The National Estuarine Eutrophication Project\nPhysical and Hydrologic Characteristics\nA principal feature of the NEI is the determination of the physical dimensions\nand hydrologic features of estuarine systems of the United States.  These data\nare  compiled in a consistent manner to allow users to distinguish the\nsimilarities and  differences among individual estuaries or groups of\nestuaries.  The physical  characteristics of an estuary are primary\ndeterminants of estuarine processes and  ultimately affect the ecology of a\nsystem.\nThe principal physical parameter for which data are  compiled is the Estuarine\nDrainage Area (EDA).  Other dimensional parameters  include the estuary length,\nwidth, and depth; the fluvial drainage area, or FDA (the  land and water\nportion of the entire watershed upstream of the EDA); and the  estuarine water\nsurface area.  The seaward boundary of each estuary is identified, and  the\nestuary's length, area and volume is estimated for five salinity zones (from\ntidal  fresh to seawater).  Estimates are also generated for the average daily\nand monthly  freshwater inflow (representing the streams discharging into the\nthe entire drainage  basin), tidal prism (the volume of water entering a\ncoastal system during flood tide),  and prevailing tide (diurnal or\nsemidiurnal) for each estuary.  Estuaries are classified  according to degree\nof salinity stratification (highly stratified, moderately stratified, and\nvertically homogeneous classifications, reported for three-month periods).\nEstuarine Land-Use Categories\nThe types of land use within an estuarine drainage basin indicate the overall\nextent to which human activities may affect the environmental quality of the\nbasin and  its waters.  The NEI compiles information relating to the types of\nland uses within the  drainage basins associated with major estuaries of the\nUnited States.  When  combined with information about other estuarine\ncharacteristics, land-use data may be  used to assess the effects of various\npolicies on the environmental quality of the  Nation's estuarine resource base.\nThe data base includes surface area estimates of seven  categories and 24\nsubcategories of land uses in areas surrounding major estuaries.   Categories\ninclude urban and built-up land (such as residential and  industrial/commercial\ncomplexes), Agriculture, Range, Forest, Barren (such as  beaches and dry salt\nflats), and Wetland land use types.  Area estimates are compiled  for three\nspatial units: (1) estuarine drainage areas (EDAs); (2) USGS cataloging units\n(the portion that falls within an EDA); and (3) counties that fall within or\nintersect EDAs  (area estimates for the entire county).\nThe data base encompasses 92 estuaries of the contiguous United  States.\nEstimates are compiled for 92 EDAs, 216 USGS cataloging units, and 523\ncounties that fall within or intersect an EDA.  The spatial resolution of the\nsupporting  data is 10 or 40 acres, depending on the land-use category.\nLand-use data were recorded between 1971 and 1984 and  compiled during the\nmid-1980s.\nSusceptibility of Estuaries to Nutrient Discharges\nThe NEI compiles data on the annual nutrient loads entering estuaries and  the\nrelative susceptibility of estuaries to nutrient-related pollution.  These data\nallow  water quality and resource managers to identify estuaries that are\npotentially at risk to  nutrient loads and subsequently, to eutrophication\nconditions.\nData relate to parameters that influence estuarine  eutrophication, based on\nnutrient loading estimates and physical and hydrologic  characteristics.\nNutrient loading data include estimates of the total nitrogen and the  total\nphosphorus discharged annually into estuaries from point, nonpoint, and\nupstream sources.  The relative susceptibility of estuaries to nutrient\npollution is  quantified by the dissolved concentration potential (DCP), an\nestimate of the relative  ability of an estuary to concentrate dissolved\nsubstances, such as nitrogen and  phosphorus.  This value characterizes the\neffect of flushing and estuarine dilution on  pollutant loads.  A\nclassification scheme, indicating high, medium or low DCP values,  is used to\nprovide a relative ranking of estuaries in terms of their susceptibility to\nnutrient pollution.\nThe level of nutrient pollution is identified by the estimated concentrations\nof nitrogen  and phosphorus, a classification of those concentrations (high,\nmedium and low  concentrations), and an estimate of what percentage change\n(increase or decrease) in  nutrient loadings would be required to change the\nnutrient concentration  classifications.  Additional data include the molecular\nratio of nitrogen to phosphorus  (N/P), which provides an estimate of which\nnutrient may be more influential in limiting  phytoplankton production.\nThe data encompass 82 estuaries identified in the NEI: 23 in the  Northeast; 17\nin the Southeast; 23 on the Gulf of Mexico; and 19 on the West coast.   The\ndata represent overall estuarine conditions, not site-specific conditions\nwithin an  estuary\nNutrient susceptibility studies were completed in 1990.   Supporting physical\nand hydrologic data were generated primarily in the last decade.   Loading\nestimates were derived from pollutant discharge data generated for the 1982\nbase year.  Base-year estimates can be considered to approximate discharge\nconditions for a five-year period around the base year.\nThe National Estuarine Eutrophication Project\nThe National Estuarine Eutrophication Project is a data collection effort\ndesigned to quantify the degree and geographical extent of eutrophication in\ncoastal  estuaries, and to test the hypothesis that nutrient loads and\neutrophic waters are  linked.  The Project expands upon related NEI studies,\ninvolving estuarine  susceptibility to nutrient loadings (noted above), by\nassessing actual eutrophication  problems and their characteristics.  A goal of\nthe Project is to develop a model linking  nutrient loading concentrations and\nphytoplankton production to determine the  probability of eutrophication\nconditions.\nData will be collected on a variety of factors which  characterize\neutrophication conditions and effects.  Hydrologic characteristics, such as\nwater residence times and circulation patterns, determine the ability of an\nestuary to  concentrate nutrient loads.  The Project will examine such physical\nindicators as  flushing, salinity, stratification, and tides.  Data also will\nbe collected on factors which  express eutrophication effects, including: 1)\nwater quality parameters, such as oxygen  concentrations in bottom waters;\nnutrient concentrations; light penetration; turbidity;  and 2) biological\nparameters, such as phytoplankton production (primary production);  the\nappearance of nuisance seaweeds, algal blooms and floating algal scums;\ndecreased submerged aquatic vegetation concentrations; benthic organism\nconcentration and composition; bacterial activity; disease organisms (for\nmarine  populations); and secondary production (commercial harvests).\nThe National Estuarine Eutrophication Project was initiated in  1991, however,\nsupporting data may relate to environmental conditions recorded at  earlier\ndates.\nPoint of contact:\nStrategic Environmental Assessment Division\nOffice of Ocean Resources Conservation and Assessment\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n6001 Executive Blvd\nRockville, MD  20852",

To main factors forming the climate of the Spitsbergen Archipelago one could refer its geographical location, atmospheric circulation, ocean impact, sea and continental ice sheet, complicated morphometrics.\nOn the Spitsbergen Archipelago there exists the huge mass of fresh water in a form of cryosphere elements (glaciers, snow cover, naleds), it has a specific biota and at the same time locates in the area of a relatively intensive economic activity compared with other Arctic Archipelagos... Thus, Cryosphere, Hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere of the Archipelago is a noticeable objects-indicator of the current status of the Arctic climate system and estimates of its future changes. Along with this Spitsbergen is a wonderful science platform for studying the overall spectrum of reactions of Polar Regions nature on the climate variations both of natural and anthropogenic origin.\nNowadays, a large complex of scientific researches and monitoring of the Spitsbergen Archipelago environment is carried out on the basis of the infrastructure of the Russian village Barents burg, Norwegian villages Longierbuen and New-Alesunn and also the Polish research base Hornsunn. Meteorological, aerological, ice, oceanographic, biological and other observations are performed.\nIt is considered to perform the following complex investigations of the Spitsbergen Archipelago environment in the framework of this project:\nMain project goals are: \n- development and unification of the existing system of complex monitoring of the principal climate forming parameters of the environment status in the area of the Spitsbergen Archipelago \nestimation of the features of the present status of the principal components of the climatic and systems of the Archipelago and surrounding Euro-Arctic aquatic regions -on the basis of the analysis of databases obtained during the project implementation and historical Russian and available international databases ;\nUnderstanding of the impact mechanisms of external climate factors on the nature of the Spitsbergen Archipelago;\ndevelopment of the scientific basis of the scenarios of possible climate changes of the Archipelago environment and forecast of possible ecological impact;\n- improvement of the technology and technical means for the system of hydrometeorological monitoring of the environment.\nThe investigations are complex ones. So, there are some separate sub-programs co-operating in the framework of general research program including the following directions:\n-Meteorological regime;\n-Hydrological regime of dry land;\n-Energy-exchange processes between the atmosphere and underlying surface;\n-Ice-cover evolution;\n-Structure and dynamics of coastal waters including fiords; \n-Climate and fresh water balance;\n-Sea-ice evolution; \n- Monitoring of contamination of air and water ambience\n-Studies of the composite and concentration of radio-active gases in the atmosphere and ocean;\n-Flora and fauna research;\n-Validation of results from remote sounding of the environment components;\n-Testing and experimental service of new measurement complexes for the Archipelago environment monitoring. \nImplementation of the above sub-programs will be realized on the basis of ZGMO «Baretsburg» (AARI, Murmansk ASMS), Norwegian research station in New Alesunn village (NPI) and Polish station in the Hornsunn Bay (Polish Academy of Sciences). Also it is assumed to perform, on the basis of the previous AARI field studies on the Archipelago, the constant-basis observations at a number of geographical objects (glaciers, lakes, river valleys, etc) for which there exist multi-year sets of field data. Here we suppose to use both automation measuring complexes and random observations using helicopters, sea- vehicles etc.",

            "definition": "Summary of Project:\n\nThe normal use of oxygen by aerobic organisms produces several active\nspecies of oxygen.  The first derivative that forms is the anion\nsuperoxide (O2-) that is a species with a negative charge, slightly\ndiffusible and relatively stable, with characteristics of free radical\n(elements with a free electron).  The second product of reduction is\nhydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a highly diffusible, stable molecule.\n\nThe union of these two species, in the presence of hemoproteins (for\nexample: hemoglobin, hemocyanin, etc.) containing prosthetic group\ntransition metals, generates a new, extremely reactive species, the\nradical hydroxyl (OH-).  This radical has a very short half life and,\ntherefore, interacts with compounds in its en be they proteins, lipids\nor acids, producing reversible or irreversible damage depending on its\nconcentration.\n\nAerobic animals and vegetables have within their cells enzymatic and\nnonenzymatic antioxidant defenses.\n\nWithin the enzymatic defenses we found: a) superoxide dismutase (SOD),\nb) catalase (CAT) and c) glutathione peroxidase (GPx):\n\na) Superoxide dismutase (SOD) with superoxide (O2-) anion produces\nhydrogen peroxide (equation 1):\nO2- + 2 H+ ---> H2O2       (1)\nThis enzyme contains prosthetic group transition metals for oxidation\n- reduction necessary for the dismutation of this species.\n\nb) Metabolized CAT to hydrogen peroxide turning it to water (equation\n2):\n2H2O2 ---> 2H2O + O2     (2)\nThis enzyme is peroxisomal in behavior, and, in addition to its\ncatalytic function, it can conduct a peroxidative battle with much\nlesser efficiency.\n\nc) GPx can also transform hydrogen peroxide into water and\nadditionally metabolizes organic peroxides such as lipoperoxides\n(equation 3):\n2 GSH + ROOH ---> GSSG + ROH + H2O     (3)\nThis enzyme uses as substrate a non-enzymatic antioxidant, - reduced\nglutathione (GSH).  This antioxidant is distributed widely in\ndifferent organs.  Its function is fundamental to maintaining\noxidation balance.  Another important non-enzymatic antioxidant is\nascorbic acid (vitamin C).  Ascorbic acid is crucial in the\nreplacement of the antioxidant activity of vitamin E.  Also, vitamin\nE, like vitamin A, is a liposoluble that is found in cell membranes,\ncatching or extinguishing excited species that are generated in the\nreduction of oxygen.\n\nPotentially, oxidative stress is experienced by aerobic organisms when\nantioxidant defenses are surpassed by pro-oxidating forces.  This\nmechanism has been implied in carcinogenesis, ischemia and reperfusion\ndamage, inflammation and aging.  Evidence suggests that the health of\naquatic organisms is linked to the level of oxidative stress to which\nthey may have been exposed (Di Giulio et al., 1989).  In particular,\nregarding processes by which natural atmospheric conditions or the\npresence of pollutants have increased the level of pro-oxidating\nsubstances.\n\nThe extreme physical characteristics of the Antarctic marine\nenvironment provide a challenge in confronting the oxidative\nmetabolism of the organisms that inhabit it, since natural situations\nlike, for example, the high oxygen content in the cold waters or\ngreater exposure to UV radiation (due to the hole in the ozone layer),\nwould have to lead to an adaptation in the activity of metabolizing\nenzymes of the reduced oxygen species, and non-enzymatic antioxidants.\nSimilarly, the presence of transition metals and/or xenobiotic\nsubstances in the water produce oxidative stress in the organisms\nexposed to these substances (Winston, 1991).\n\nProject Duration: 2002 - 2004\n\nEn Espanol:\nResumen del Proyecto:\n\n  Como consecuencia de la utilizacion normal del oxigeno por los\norganismos aerobicos, se producen varias especies activas del oxigeno.\n\n  El primer derivado que se forma es el anion superoxido (O2.-) que es\nuna especie con carga, poco difusible y relativamente estable, con\ncaracteristicas de radical libre (elementos con un electron\ndesapareado). El segundo producto de la reduccion es el peroxido de\nhidrogeno (H2 O2), molecula estable altamente difusible.\n\n        La union de estas dos especies, en presencia de hemoproteinas (por\nejemplo: hemoglobina, hemocianina, etc.) que contengan metales de\ntransicion en su grupo prostetico, genera una nueva especie\nextremadamente reactiva que es el radical hidroxilo (OH.). Este\nradical tiene una vida media muy corta por lo que interactua con los\ncompuestos de sus alrededores ya sean proteinas, lipidos o acidos\nnucleicos, produciendo danos de caracter reversible o irreversible\ndependiendo de su concentracion.\n\n        Los animales y vegetales aerobios tienen dentro de sus celulas\ndefensas antioxidantes enzimaticas y no enzimaticas radical hidroxilo\n(OH.). Este radical tiene una vida media muy corta por lo que\ninteractua con los compuestos de sus alrededores ya sean proteinas,\nlipidos o acidos nucleicos, produciendo danos de caracter reversible o\nirreversible dependiendo de su concentracion.\n\n        Los animales y vegetales aerobios tienen dentro de sus celulas\ndefensas antioxidantes enzimaticas y no enzimaticas.\n\n  Dentro de las defensas enzimaticas encontramos: a) superoxido\ndismutasa (SOD), b) catalasa (CAT) y c) glutation peroxidasa (GPx).\n\na) La SOD dismuta el anion superoxido a peroxido de hidrogeno (ecuacion 1).\n O2.-    + 2 H+  ---> H2 O2        (1)\n\nEsta enzima contiene metales de transicion en su grupo prostetico con\nlos que realiza las oxido - reducciones necesarias para la dismutacion\nde esta especie.\n\nb) La CAT metaboliza al peroxido de hidrogeno convirtiendolo en agua\n(ecuacion 2).\n\n2 H2O2 ---> 2 H2O + O2     (2)\n\nEsta enzima es de ubicacion peroxisomal y ademas de su funcion\ncatalitica puede realizar una accion peroxidativa con mucha menor\neficiencia.\n\nc) La GPx tambien puede transformar el peroxido de hidrogeno en agua y\nademas metaboliza peroxidos de tipo organicos tales como los\nlipoperoxidos (ecuacion 3)\n\n2 GSH +  ROOH  ? GSSG + ROH + H2O  (3)\n\nEsta enzima utiliza como sustrato a un antioxidante no enzimatico, que\nes el glutation reducido (GSH). Este antioxidante se encuentra\nampliamente distribuido en los distintos organos. Su funcion es\nfundamental para mantener el equilibrio oxidativo.\n\n  Otro de los antioxidantes no enzimaticos importantes es el acido\nascorbico (vitamina C). Este compuesto es fundamental en la reposicion\nde la actividad antioxidante de la vitamina E. Tanto la vitamina E\ncomo la A son compuestos de caracteristicas liposolubles que se\nencuentran en la membrana de las celulas atrapando o apagando las\nespecies excitadas que se generan en la reduccion del oxigeno.  El\nestres oxidativo, potencialmente, es experimentado por todos los\norganismos aerobicos cuando las defensas antioxidantes son superadas\npor las fuerzas prooxidantes. Este mecanismo se ha visto implicado en\ncarcinogenesis, dano de isquemia y reperfusion, inflamacion y\nenvejecimiento. Existe evidencia que indica que la salud de los\norganismos acuaticos puede estar ligada al nivel de estres oxidativo\nal que se encuentran expuestos (Di Giulio et al., 1989). En particular\nsobre aquellos procesos por los cuales las condiciones naturales del\nambiente o la presencia de sustancias contaminantes hubiesen\nincrementado el nivel de prooxidantes presentes.\n\nLas caracteristicas fisicas extremas del medio ambiente marino\nantartico, plantean un desafio a confrontar sobre el metabolismo\noxidativo de los organismos que lo habitan, ya que situaciones\nnaturales como, por ejemplo, el alto contenido de oxigeno de sus frias\naguas o la mayor exposicion a la radiacion UV (debido a la presencia\ndel agujero en la capa de ozono), deberian conducir a una adaptacion\nen la actividad de las enzimas metabolizadoras de las especies\nreducidas del oxigeno y en los niveles de los antioxidantes no\nenzimaticos. Del mismo modo la presencia de metales de transicion y/o\nde sustancias xenobioticas organicas en el agua se sabe que producen\nestres oxidativo en los organismos expuestos a dichas sustancias\n(Winston, 1991).

The region thus provides an adequate subject for the development of remote sensing and modeling methods which will be useful at global scales and in other regions. We propose to estimate carbon pools in this region using remotely-sensed inputs from the NASA Earth Observing System satellites Terra and Aqua. \n\n\nWe are working to refine mapping of vegetation through improved plant community type differentiation, estimating contributions from soil, shrub and grass components and provision of structural measures. This addresses three aspects of the problem of estimating C pools: large differences in total C storage in different plant communities; the need to reliably estimate the areal proportions of soil, grass and shrubs; and the need to obtain measures of canopy structure over large areas. \n\n\nWe are working towards these goals using multi-angle spectral reflectance data and derived parameters and metrics from the MISR and MODIS instruments. The approach is based on the premise that incorporating multi-angle measures in plant community type mapping results in substantial improvements in classification and mapping; that canopy heterogeneity is reflected in these data; and that useful canopy structure measures are available in the angular domain. \n\n\nFrom 2006, we began working at the regional scale and included maps of forest canopy parameters from MISR.",

The IPY will approximately take place during the period of peak concentrations of man-made ozone depleting substances in the region of the ozone layer. It is also the time when potential effects from climate change, e.g. changes in temperature, water vapour abundances, and/or circulation, might begin to manifest in the stratosphere and influence ozone recovery. In April 2005, nearly eighteen years after the signing of the Montreal Protocol (MP), ozone loss is as severe as ever over the Arctic, and the timing and extent of ozone recovery is uncertain. Depletion of stratospheric ozone in polar regions has greatly enhanced harmful UV radiation in the affected areas at times of the year when ecosystems are vulnerable. The state of the polar stratosphere, and its future development will be, therefore, a major source of concern, both for circumpolar communities and people living at lower latitudes in the International Polar Year (IPY) and for decades thereafter. \n\nThe project will be divided into seven main activities: \n\n1) ozone loss (detection and impact on UV radiation, \n2) PSC (polar stratospheric clouds) and cirrus, \n3) atmospheric chemistry, \n4) UV radiation, \n5) ozone and climate change and feedback, \n6) data management, and \n7) education, outreach and communication.\n\nThe project implies precisely quantification of polar ozone losses in both hemispheres achieved with concerted international campaigns during which hundreds of ozonesondes will be launched in real-time coordination from station networks in the Arctic and Antarctic. Satellite coverage of ozone and ozone depleting substances will be unprecedented during the IPY, and data from satellites such as ENVISAT, Aura, ACE, Odin, POAM III and SAGE III will be used in a novel approach that combines these measurements with groundbased station data. \n\nUnderstanding ozone depletion requires an understanding of PSCs which are known to initiate ozone depletion through heterogeneous reactions and enhance ozone depletion through removal of nitric acid (denitrification) by cloud sedimentation. Chemical, microphysical, and optical properties of polar cloud particles and gas phase species will be obtained in-situ and remotely from stratospheric balloons and several aircraft, including the high altitude research aircraft Geophysica during a major Arctic field campaign. Complementary particle information will be gained by lidar observations from several Arctic and Antarctic NDSC (Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change) research stations, including the development of PSC detection capabilities with the satellite borne CALIPSO lidar.\n\nDuring the project ground-based observations will be performed at many Arctic and Antarctic NDSC-stations by means of remote sensing instruments operating in the infrared, UV/Vis and microwave spectral regions to measure the seasonal and long-term variability of ozone, water vapour, and numerous key ozone-related trace gases in the stratosphere, in addition to tropospheric pollutants, greenhouse gases, and biomass burning. Radiosonde, lidar and satellite will provide measurements of wind and temperatures in the troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere. The project also comprehends monitoring of UV-, visible, and infrared radiation and ground/sea/ice albedo in various high latitude stations in the northern and southern hemisphere together with modelling studies of ozone and UV in these regions, including an epidemiological study of personal UV exposure. \n\nIntegration of field data and process studies within a modelling framework will enable predictions the future evolution of the ozone layer as well as the potential feedback on the future polar climate. The modelling efforts will focus on assimilating the observations to yield a comprehensive understanding that can both reproduce the observed circulation and chemical evolution and predict the Arctic and Antarctic middle atmosphere response to changes in the circulation and atmospheric chemistry. Atmospheric effects of manifestations of solar activity as the short-term changes of the cosmic ray intensity, variations of the interplanetary electric field and variations of the solar UV-irradiation will be included. Interactively coupled chemistry-climate models (CCMs) of the troposphere and the stratosphere will be used to investigate past and to assess future changes of climate and atmospheric chemical composition at higher geographical latitudes of the Earth atmosphere, particularly of ozone recovery in the stratosphere. Related changes of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation will be determined.",

WEST was comprised of modeling and field observations. The primary goal of WEST was to better describe and understand the competing influences of wind forcing on planktonic productivity in coastal waters. While increased upwelling-favorable winds lead to increased nutrient supply, they also result in reduced light exposure due to deeper surface mixed layers and increased advective loss of plankton from coastal waters. The key to understanding high levels of productivity, amidst these competing responses to wind forcing, is the temporal and spatial structure of upwelling. Temporal fluctuations and spatial patterns allow strong upwelling that favors nutrient delivery to be juxtaposed with less energetic conditions that favor stratification and plankton blooms. \n\nhttp://repositories.cdlib.org/postprints/2402/",

Our approach is to utilize the forest age and biomass results based on time series Landsat and FIA data developed by a currently funded NASA Carbon Cycle Science Project (North American Forest Disturbance and Regrowth Since 1972, PI: S. N. Goward). Dense time series data for a number of forested scenes (>25) in the US and Canada will be used to initialize and calibrate a biogeochemical model that predicts gross and net carbon fluxes. Model testing will include appropriate Ameriflux, LTER, NACP Tier 2, and FIA data. Climate variability (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation) will also be included in the analysis. Then using less temporally dense satellite data but wall to wall continental coverage, the modeling will predict gross and net carbon fluxes resulting from disturbance history and climate for the forests of North America. The products of this study will be used by our collaborators as boundary conditions for atmospheric transport (forward and inversion) models. By reconciling top-down (atmosphere) and bottom-up (biogeochemistry) analyses of the net fluxes we will be able to estimate accuracy and uncertainty in our model results.",

The\nproject which eventually had over 100 researchers, was headed by\nNorwegian Oceanographer Ola M.

They sought to\nseek the infulence of the huge air masses on the weather systems of\nthe Northern hemisphere.\n\nMIZEX gained the scientists valuable information on the way ice is\naffected by winds, current, waves and movement.  Tests were done on\nthe thickness and toughness of the ice, as well as experiments to show\nwhat happens when the drift ice comes up against the warmer waters of\nthe Atlantic Ocean.\n\nOn its first year of the expedition, it was predicted to spend nearly\n&#364 million (U.S.), an amount which was to be expanded to\n&#368 million by 1984.

In this area, highly populated and prone to devastating earthquakes and tsunamis, excellent geological/geophysical knowledge has already been acquired in the last decade.\n\nThe methodological approach will be based on the cross-checking of multi parameter time series acquired on land by seismic and tide gauge stations on the seafloor and in the water column by broad band Ocean Bottom Seismometers and a multi parameter deep-sea platform, this latter equipped with real-time communication to an onshore warning centre. Land and sea data will be integrated to be used in a prototype of EWS.\n\nNEAREST will search for sedimentological evidence of tsunamis records to improve the knowledge on the recurrence time for extreme events and will try to measure the key parameters for the comprehension of the tsunami generation mechanisms. The proposed method can be extended to other near-shore potential tsunamigenic sources, as for instance the Central Mediterranean (Western Ionian Sea), Aegean Arc and Marmara Sea.",

Cooperation will be on equal terms. Other scientific and monitoring institutions, both through IPY-related and other projects, cooperate as consultants. \n\nThe project idea was initiated by the Association of Nenets People 'Yasavey' of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug (NAO, Northwestern Russia), which has in their files documented a rather chaotic development of oil-related activities in the NAO; these activities have severe impacts on nature, reindeer pastures and the socio-economic situation of the indigenous people living in and of the land. Reindeer pastures have been and are continually destroyed and polluted. Numerous violations of Russian environmental law by oil companies seem to occur. To collect and make easily available data on this development, an Internet-based electronic GIS database and explanatory report showing these activities will be created.  Data monitoring will use personal observations of 'Yasavey' members and other native representatives, questioning of native individuals in selected areas of the NAO, photo documentation, published data, inquiries at oil companies, satellite image surveying, etc. We also discuss cooperation with the Nenets Information and Analytical Center (NIAC) in the NAO.\n\nThe project is essentially a monitoring project. The GIS database will show the physical and ethno- geography (indigenous settlements and traditional land use areas) of the NAO, as well as all visible and detected impacts derived from hydrocarbon prospecting and production (drilling sites, pipelines, major vehicle track lines, damaged tundra areas, spills, etc.) as an interactive map to the scale of 1:1 mill. Details about the locations will be linked to the map in text and image format. The database will use technical solutions which have been successfully used for other topics at the Norwegian Polar Institute.\nThe accompanying report(s), to be prepared in print and on the Internet (in English and Russian), will discuss the observations in environmental, socio-economic, ethnic and human-security-related contexts. For this purpose, a working group consisting of indigenous representatives from the NAO and international experts on these topics will be formed. The discussion will incorporate experiences from similar activities in indigenous land use areas made in other parts of Russia and North America. Specialists from Canada and the Komi Republic have already indicated their interest in joining the project, while others are still to be addressed. \n\nSuch a database can be used towards management and authorities as a documentation of illegal actions, and towards oil companies for negotiations on compensation claims. At the same time, the project will train Yasavey's staff in using GIS. The project can also function as a pilot project for other areas in the circumpolar North.\n\nDependent on available funding, the project can be carried out as a one-year's project, or a several years' project in order to monitor annual changes of the situation. The least desirable length would be two years, 2007 and 2008, which would provide an indication of the annual development.",

It is highly remarked that the combination with the buoy network deployed in this region is essential for this experiment, since it helps not only to study the heat budget but also to capture the long-term and wide-range atmospheric and oceanic features. In addition, as the MJO propagates eastward, zonal extension of the observational area is strongly desired. Thus, meteorological observations at Maldives Islands will also be conducted under the cooperation with the Maldives officials.  \n\nhttp://www.jamstec.go.jp/iorgc/mismo/index-e.html",

Peak performance of most OWC systems occurs at resonance with the driving waves. At resonance, oscillations increase linearly in time until damping inhibits further growth. Parametric resonance is introduced as a means of exciting the oscillations of the water column. In parametric resonance, oscillations increase exponentially in time. The use of this kind of resonance may increase the performance of OWC systems. This type of resonance occurs when one of the parameters in an oscillator varies periodically. Asymptotic methods are used to study the nonlinear dynamics of an OWC with parametric resonance. These results are compared with those of a numerical model of a real experimental laboratory setup.\n\nhttp://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/engi/2007/00000057/00000001/00009048",

The first monitoring sites of the NADP precipitation\nchemistry network was started in 1978 to provide information about\ngeographical patterns and temporal trends in the deposition of acidic\nchemicals and nutrients. The NADP was initially organized as Regional\nProject NC-141 by the North Central Region of the SAES. The NADP was\nendorsed by all four regions in 1982. when it became Interregional\nProject IR-7. Ten years later IR-7 was reclassified as a National\nResearch Support Project, NRSP-3.\n\nIn 1982, the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP)\nwas established. The NADP assumed responsibility for coordinating the\nNational Trends Network (NTN) of NAPAP since both the NADP and NTN had\ncommon siting criteria and operational procedures, and shared a common\nanalytical laboratory.

At the peak of the last ice age 25,000 years ago, sea level was 120 meters (400 feet) lower than it is at present because water that is now part of the ocean was instead part of expanded glaciers and ice sheets in North America, Eurasia, and Antarctica. Between then and now, melting and retreat of this land ice caused sea level to rise. In this project, we aim to improve our understanding of how changes in the size of the Antarctic Ice Sheet contributed to this process. The overall strategy to accomplish this involves (i) visiting areas in Antarctica that are not now covered by ice; (ii) looking for geological evidence, specifically rock surface and sediment deposits, that indicates that these areas were covered by thicker ice in the past; and (iii) determining the age of these geological surfaces and deposits. This project addresses the final part of this strategy -- determining the age of Antarctic glacial rock surfaces or sediment deposits -- using a relatively new technique that involves measuring trace elements in rock surfaces that are produced by cosmic-ray bombardment after the rock surfaces are exposed by ice retreat. By applying this method to rock samples collected in previous visits to Antarctica, the timing of past expansion and contraction of the ice sheet can be determined. The main scientific outcomes expected from this project are (i) improved understanding of how Antarctic Ice Sheet changes contributed to past global sea level rise; and (ii) improved understanding of modern observed Antarctic Ice Sheet changes in a longer-term context. This second outcome will potentially improve predictions of future ice sheet behavior. Other outcomes of the project include training of individual undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the development of a new course on sea level change to be taught at Tulane University in New Orleans, a city that is being affected by sea level change today.",

The NRC conducts studies that provide a science community consensus on key questions posed by NASA and other U.S. Government agencies. The broadest of these studies in NASA’s areas of research are decadal surveys.

A secondary objective of the mission was to develop a microwave capability to discriminate between melt ponds and seawater using low-frequency microwave radiometers. Meltpond2000 was a multiagency effort involving personnel from the Navy, NOAA, and NASA. The field component of the mission consisted of making five 8-hour flights from Thule Air Base, Greenland with a Naval Air Warfare Center P-3 aircraft over portions of Baffin Bay and the Canadian Arctic. The aircraft sensors were provided and operated by the Microwave Radiometry Group of NOAA's Environmental Technology Laboratory. A Navy ice observer with the National Ice Center provided visual documentation of surface ice conditions during each of the flights. Two of the five flights were coordinated with Canadian scientists making surface measurements of melt ponds at an ice camp located near Resolute Bay, Canada. Coordination with the Canadians will provide additional information on surface characteristics and will be of great value in the interpretation of the aircraft and high-resolution satellite data sets.\n\nSummary provided by http://polynya.gsfc.nasa.gov/seaice_mp2000.html",

In 1878\n       Baird became the second secretary of the Smithsonian\n       Institution, a position he held until his death in 1887. Baird\n       was an avid naturalist with a bent towards the marine\n       environment. His interest lead to the hiring of such eminent\n       naturalists as Leonard Stejneger and William H. Dall. Although\n       Stejneger was most known for his work in herpetology and Dall\n       in mollusks, they were part of a body of researchers who\n       contributed to the study of marine mammals whenever\n       possible.

While the phenomenon of state-induced population movements in the circumpolar North in the 20th and 21st centuries is well-known, to date no comparative analysis of their local and regional contexts and impacts has been undertaken. Although the role of the state in shaping the North has received some belated attention in recent years, the local expressions of moving, coping, rebuilding and remembering remain to be understood.\n\nIf seasonal and permanent population movements in the lives of circumpolar peoples were in the past responsive to the local conditions upon which subsistence life ways were based, population movements in the recent history of the North have been imposed by market and state logics of a conspicuously non-local character. Previous research on forms of relocation and resettlement sponsored by outside institutions has focused almost exclusively on the political motivations and repercussions, as well as demographic consequences of such movement. While these lines of inquiry are important, they provide few clues about local perceptions and impacts, or the persistent power of local agency to resist and condition projects of relocation. Similarly, while there is a long history of social science involvement with northern development planning and more recently with the sustainability of development -, there is a general failure to address the importance of social fabric within the context of resettlement and other population movements.\n\nMoved by the state refers to the commonality of having to cope with relocations and other population movements triggered by outside decisions. In analyzing a broad array of case studies (small and large, indigenous and non-indigenous communities, in free market and central command systems, ranging from the mid-20th to the early 21st century), the collaborative research project intends to test the extent of commonality. Demographic, political, social and cultural variables will be used to track the similarities and differences, both among communities facing being moved now and those that have been moved in the past. Extensive fieldwork, combining participant observation, various interview and survey strategies, and the recording of oral and life histories, as well as demographic and economic data collection and analysis, will form the methodological backbone of the project. Thus, the impact of past and present relocations will be addressed through a dual strategy. On the one hand, a series of regional analyses of aggregate economic and demographic data will provide an overall picture of the population movements in question. On the other hand, ethnographic fieldwork in selected villages and towns of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia will add local context and emic perspectives.\n\nIn theoretical terms, the proposed research addresses the tension between the increasingly translocal and various senses of place. The question of how local identities, in or out of place (of origin) are constituted leads to a critical interrogation of the roles of cultural and practical engagements in creating and recreating place within a particular environment. The results of this research will become increasingly relevant in the ongoing negotiations between states and communities about location and relocation in the face of increasing social and climate change.",

Over 20% of the goods produced in the West involve the use of PGEs somewhere in their manufacturing processes and Pt and Pd are the most widely used ones. Especially with automobile industry, noble metals and their compounds have been widely used as catalysts in automobile catalytic pollution control devices. Though those pollutants are mainly local, they are also transported to remote Arctic regions. What are the trends for those metals at present? How different comparing the current situation with the one in pre-industrial time period? Because one of the common characteristics for noble metals is reducing activation energy at reaction centres during chemical reactions and this characteristic could hold true for biochemical reactions, increasing worldwide pollution of PGEs may potentially exert affects on bio chemical reactions in the ecosystems and food chains. It is therefore of great value to investigate their past, present and trend in Arctic regions where undisturbed frozen water media preserves their archives.\n\nThis proposal is addressing some of those questions, aiming to:\n\n1.To develop precise methodologies to determine the concentrations of those noble metals in the Canadian High Arctic, down to fg/g level or 10-15 gram per gram in order to accurately quantify the content of those pollutants in the ice. This work will require special ultra-clean technique, equipment/facility and expertises, which GSC (Geological Survey Canada, NRCan) and UH (University of Heidelberg, Germany) currently holds;\n\n2.To reconstruct a temporal trend of those noble metal pollutants in the Canadian High Arctic for at least 50 years, possibly tracing back to pre-industrial time. This work requires precise dating and multi-discipline knowledge, including glaciology, ice-physics, analytical chemistry, statistics and geochemistry et al. Both GSC and UH also holds expertise in these fields. The site for this study is tentatively selected to be on Agassiz ice cap, Nunavut, Canada (Northern Ellesmere Island: 80 deg 48.0 N 72 deg 52.5 W; asl 1800 m);\n\n3.To investigate the spatial distribution of those noble metal pollutants on ice caps, at least 4 to 6 ice caps will be occupied; and 4.Hopefully to apportion the sources of the pollutants whenever possible with the achieved data.",

Initial projects by this team have shown that the basic patterns of disturbance can be evaluated using change detection methods and that regrowth can be evaluated from inferences of forest structural change noted by spectral reflectance changes. Collaboration with the US Forest Service has provided important access to Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data that permit direct comparison of the satellite-based spectral reflectance patterns with ground-based forest structural attributes. Finally, our capacity to process large volumes of Landsat satellite data has been demonstrated by a series of recent projects (REALM, LEDAPS). \n\nWe will employ a statistically robust sampling system to select ~25 Landsat WRS locations within the coterminous US to conduct compartive Landsat/FIA analysis of recent disturbance and regrowth patterns. In addition, we are collaborating with our Canadian colleagues as they pursue similar analyses in their country. Combined, these analyzes will provide a continental-scale assessment of North American forest dynamics from 1972 to present. \n\nA dense biennual time-series of Landsat imagery 1972-2005) are being assembled for each lselected ocation.

Concomitant with the ecological data regarding these top predators, a vast, high-precision oceanographic data set will be collected covering logistically difficult areas of ocean in Polar Seas at the fringes of the North and South Atlantic and the South Pacific that are strategically important to climate and ocean modelling. The cross-disciplinary merging of classical oceanography and marine mammal ecology will significantly advance our understanding of the world's oceans and top predators that live in them.\n\n\nMEOP partners will deploy CTD-tags on beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), hooded seals (Cystophora cristata), Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii), crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) and southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina). Most of these species are very deep divers, with maximum dive depths that exceed 1000 m. Virtually all marine mammals forage in oceanic 'hot-spots' where productivity is high, which also coincide with human fisheries efforts and areas of high oceanographic interest. Our target species inhabit areas with significant seasonal ice-cover in both the Arctic and the Antarctic, the edges of which are of particular interest to oceanographers in terms of deep-water formation. Ice-filled waters are rarely sampled by standard oceanographic studies using ships or other methodologies especially over extended times because of logistical and cost constraints, but they are routinely visited by these polar marine mammals. MEOPs oceanographic data will also ehance our ability to accurately model currents and deal with basin scale models.\n\nIPY affords a unique opportunity to collect novel data sets from relatively little-known polar marine mammal species simultaneously with dedicated oceanographic cruises sampling along systematic grids using traditional ship-based CTD technology. Co-operation between biological and oceanographic programmes within IPY will provide MEOP with comprehensive, synoptic oceanographic coverage that will provide a unique opportunity to quantify factors determining habitat selection and use by key polar marine mammal species. The oceanographic data collected in MEOP will, in turn, provide otherwise unobtainable oceanographic data sets collected at natural hot-spots of productivity, as input data to physically-oriented modelling projects (e.g. the Bipolar Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation Programme, Transport through gaps across the Kerguelen Plateau andinter-basin exchange).\n\nThis study is especially timely given the predictions for ecosystem changes in both Arctic and Antarctic systems within the coming decades due to climate change, in addition to increasing fisheries and tourism activities in both the Arctic and Antarctic.",

These relatively high concentrations of Hg represent an important health issue for the rural indigenous native arctic communities consuming these products. The distribution of Hg in the top level of the arctic food web is well mirrored by the concentration of Hg in seabird eggs, where spatial differences exist between the Alaskan and Canadian arctic, with a marked Hg increase observed since 1975 in the Canadian arctic and distinct Hg signatures that are measured between seabird colonies residing in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea, signatures that are subject to an apparent year-to-year variability and species specific effects. These spatial and temporal patterns as well as the levels of Hg in the food web prompt several fundamental questions on the nature of the sources of Hg that need to be answered through research, namely relative anthropogenic/natural contributions of Hg throughout and across ecosystems, the processes driving these patterns (i.e., sources, atmospheric transport and deposition, ocean currents, and evolution of the food web structure), their linkages and their respective contributions over time. \nAll these processes need to be assessed on a spatial scale (considering arctic and sub-arctic regions) as well as on a temporal scale to evaluate the amplitude of these factors over time. In the absence of extensive Hg atmospheric monitoring stations in Alaska and also considering the variability and scarcity of data on Hg and MeHg levels in snow and seawater in Alaska, no direct temporal and spatial approaches can be conducted.

The field expedition for this international partnership involves scientific investigations along two overland traverses in East Antarctica: one going from the Norwegian Troll Station to the United States South Pole Station in 2007-2008; and a return traverse by a different route in 2008-2009. This project will investigate climate change in East Antarctica, with the following goals:\n\n    * Investigate climate variability in Dronning Maud Land of East Antarctica on time scales of years to a million years.\n    * Establish spatial and temporal variability in snow accumulation over this area of Antarctica to understand its impact on sea level.\n    * Investigate the impact of atmospheric and oceanic variability on the chemical composition of firn and ice in the region.\n    * Revisit areas and sites first explored by traverses in the 1960’s, for detection of possible changes and to establish benchmark data sets for future research efforts.\n\n\nFor more information, see http://traverse.npolar.no/",

            "definition": "The Mediterranean Alpine Experiment (MEDALPEX) formed an additional part of the\nGlobal Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) subprogram on the airflow over and\naround mountains.  MEDALPEX ran concurrently with the Garp Alpine Experiment\n(ALPEX) - over the year from 1 September 1981 to 30 September 1982 with a\nspecial observation period (SOP) from 15 february 1982 to 30 April 1982.  The\nmain aim of ALPEX was to study processes such as lee cyclogenesis and severe\nlocal winds (for example the Mistral and the Bora), which have two frequency\npeaks during the year, one in November and the other in April.  This was one of\nthe reasons for the SOP in April.\nThe Mediterranean is a deep enclosed sea where tides are small and motion is\nessentially due to atmospheric forcing.  Oceanographic experiments with\nsimultaneous meterological data collection are necessary for a better\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the Mediterranean and for setting up well\ncalibrated models.  The Mediterranean may also be regarded as a small scale\nmodel of the ocean.  Thus studies on the dynamics of gyres, fronts, baroclinic\ninstabilities, eddies, turbulent dissipation and intermittancy, especially\nduring storm conditions, can contribute to the understanding of energy\ntransfers in the ocean and its boundaries.  The mesoscale eddies and meanders\nwhich play an essential role in this circulation, forming the summer\nthermocline and winter convection may also be studied.  All of the above rely\nheavily on the spatial and temporal aspects of meterological processes.\nThe primary function of MEDALPEX was to study the response of the western part\nof the Mediterranean to wind forcing.  The experiments which took place, often\nas part of an individual country's oceanographic research program, were\ndesigned with the intention of increasing understanding of the general problem\nof meterological and oceanographic interactions.  Specific topics under\ninvestigation included:\ni) the interrelationship between the general circulation and mesoscale eddies;\nii) offshore dynamic response mechanisms under severe weather conditions.  The\nbehavior of the Mediterranean under severe weather conditions when\noceanographic ships cannot operate has, until now, yielded only limited\ninformation.  MEDALPEX sought to collect data (especially during the SOP) to\ngive more complete information during periods of bad weather;\niii)storm surges and coastal piling up - for the Adriatic Sea, more detailed\nverification of storm surges can be carried out with improved wind field data.\nThe Ligurian Sea has very small tides but sea level rises and coastal waves\nduring cyclogenesis damage the coastline.  With good wind field, wave and sea\nlevel data, a model may be developed to simulate this.\nMEDALPEX was a multinational program with participants from seven countries\n(Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, U.K., U.S.S.R and Yugoslavia).  A wide range of\noceanographic data, including data from tide gauges, current meters, thermistor\nchains, waverider buoys, CTD's and XBT's were collected.  Classical and synopt\nmeterological measurements were made and remote sensing techniques used.  The\ndata resulting from MEDALPEX were to be forwarded to the Responsible National\nOceanographic Data Center (RNODC) - in this case the World Data Center B\n(Oceanography) in Moscow - with the exception of the sea level data.  The\nPermanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) undertook to act as the Sea Level\nData Center for MEDALPEX; the data management and banking was carried out by the\nMarine Information and Advisory Service (MIAS).",

That is to say that the state\nof a geographic feature is described by a set of properties where each property\ncan be thought of as a {name, type, value} tuple. The name, number, and type of\neach feature property is determined by its type definition. Geographic features\nare those that may have at least one property that is geometry-valued. This, of\ncourse, implies that features can be defined with no geometric properties at\nall. The geometries of geographic features are restricted to what OGC calls\nsimple geometries. A simple geometry is one for which coordinates are defined\nin two dimensions and the delineation of a curve is subject to linear\ninterpolation. The traditional 0, 1 and 2-dimensional geometries defined in a\n2-dimensional spatial reference system are represented by points, line strings\nand polygons. In addition, the OGC geometry model allows for geometries that\nare collections of other geometries - either homogeneous multi-point,\nmulti-line string, and multi-polygon collections or heterogeneous geometry\ncollections.

The AM-1 satellite was placed in a\n705km, sun-synchronous orbit with a 10:30am equator crossing\ntime. MOPITT will measure carbon monoxide and methane in the\ntroposphere over the entire globe for a period of five years.\n\nDespite the fact that we all live in the troposphere, monitoring\nof the tropospheric composition from space has lagged\nconsiderably behind our monitoring of the upper regions of the\nearth's atmosphere mainly because of the technical difficulty of\nsuch measurements. The presence of the earth's surface provides\nconsiderable interference to most measurement methodologies and\nthe presence of clouds further impedes the mission. Overcoming\nthese problems requires a very precise instrument with a very\nhigh performance.\n\nWe want to monitor carbon monoxide and methane because they will\nhelp us understand how the troposphere reacts to various\nstimuli. These can range from natural phenomena such as the\ngrowth of forests, through agricultural sources such as rice\npaddies, to catastrophic events such as biomass burning. Most of\nthese sources can, and indeed are, being modified by human\nactivity on the planet.\n\nCarbon monoxide is particularly interesting because of its\npotential for showing us how chemicals are transported in the\ntroposphere as well as giving us information about chemical\nreactions in the troposphere.\n\nMeasurements have already shown us the production of carbon\nmonoxide in biomass burning and its transport by atmospheric\ncirculation systems. This needs to be understood on a global\nscale and incorporated into models of tropospheric transport.\n\nMethane is a greenhouse gas and the major issue here is its\nsource strength. There are a large number of potential sources,\nsuch as northern wetlands, ruminant animals, and natural gas\nleakage. However the actual strength of the individual sources\nis very poorly known. Since methane's greenhouse effect is far\nstronger than that of the better known carbon dioxide, changes\nin methane, although small in themselves, can potentially have a\nsignificant effect on the overall climate system.\n\nMeasurements of these gases are made by intercepting the\ninfra-red radiation coming from the planet and then isolating\nthe required signals. MOPITT is a nadir sounding instrument\nsince this gives the maximal chance of avoiding cloud features,\nbut this implies that it can 'see' the surface of the planet and\nthe desired signals must be seen against the background of the\nsurface radiation. The field-of-view of MOPITT is 22 x 22km and\nit views four fields simultaneously by the use of a 4 x 1 array\nof detector elements. The field of view is also continuously\nscanned through a swath about 600km wide as the instrument moves\nalong the orbit increasing both the spatial coverage of the\ninstrument and the chance of finding gaps in the cloud coverage.\n\nThe MOPITT instrument makes use of the principle of correlation\nspectroscopy whereby a cell of the gas to be measured is used as\nan optical filter in the infra-red to measure the signal from\nthe same gas in the atmosphere. The amount of gas in the\ninstrument cell is modulated by varying either the pressure or\nthe length. In addition to the correlation technique MOPITT\nmakes use of mechanically cooled detectors and filters (at 100K)\nto enhance the overall performance. The use of this cooling\ntechnique, which relies on Stirling Cycle coolers supplied by\nBritish Aerospace, is relatively new in satellite\ninstrumentation having been used on only two civilian satellite\ninstruments before. The use of mechanical cooling rather than\nstored cryogen or radiative cooling permits a relatively large\namount of cooling - sufficient for both the detectors and the\nfilter systems - whilst still permitting a five year instrument\nlife.\n\nThe MOPITT science team is international, having members from\nCanada, the United States and the United Kingdom. The instrument\nitself is being constructed by a consortium of Canadian\ncompanies: COMDEV Atlantic of Moncton, BOMEM from Quebec City,\nHughes-Leitz from Midland and SED from Saskatoon. The instrument\nis funded by the Space Science Division of the Canadian Space\nAgency. The instrument will be tested in the University of\nToronto.\n\nMOPITT completed its Preliminary Design Review in December 1993\nand the Critical Design Review is scheduled for April\n1995. Instrument delivery will be late in 1996 and the launch of\nthe AM-1 platform will be in mid- 1998. Discussions are under\nway regarding a second copy of the instrument to be launched in\nthe 2003 time frame to permit the dataset of carbon monoxide and\nmethane to be extended to ten years to look for long term\neffects.\n\nFor more information,\nlink to 'http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/MOPITT/home.html'\n\n[Summary provided by Univesity of Toronto]",

The field study component of the project was conducted in 1992\nand contained two intensive monitoring periods (~30 days in the winter\nand ~50 days in the summer). Unique, non-depositing, non-reactive\nperfluorocarbon tracer (PFT) materials were continuously released from\nthe MPP stack during the two intensive periods to enable the tracking\nof emissions specifically from MPP. Tracer, ambient particulate\ncomposition, and SO2 concentrations were measured at about 30\nlocations in a four-state region.  Two of these monitoring sites, Hopi\nPoint (HOPO) near the main visitor center at the south rim of the\ncanyon and Meadview (MEAD) near the far western end of the national\npark were used as key receptor sites representative of GCNP.\n\nProject MOHAVE operated under the joint technical and program\nmanagement of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Southern\nCalifornia Edison (SCE) in close partnership with the National Park\nService (NPS). Numerous other organizations contributed to the\noperations and assessment work of the project. Since the end of the\nfield study component of the project, data assessment and modeling\nefforts were undertaken by the many participants and have led to\nnumerous papers and reports. By design these efforts have been the\nproducts of their respective authors and have not been endorsed as\nfindings of Project MOHAVE.\n\nThe primary goal of Project MOHAVE was to determine the contribution\nof the MPP emissions to haze at GCNP and other nearby mandatory Class\nI areas where visibility is an important air quality related\nvalue. Secondary goals included an increased knowledge of the\ncontributions of other sources to haze in GCNP and the southwestern\nUnited States in general.  The specific objectives to accomplish these\ngoals were:\n\n      1.Evaluate the measurements for applicability to modeling and\n      data analysis activities.\n\n      2.Describe the visibility, air quality and meteorology during\n      the field study period and to determine the degree to which\n      these measurements represent typical visibility events at the\n      Grand Canyon.\n\n      3.Further develop conceptual models of physical and chemical\n      processes which affect visibility impairment at the Grand\n      Canyon.\n\n      4.Estimate the contributions from different emissions sources to\n      visibility impairment at the Grand Canyon, and quantitatively\n      evaluate the uncertainties of those estimates.\n\n      5.Reconcile different scientific interpretations of the same\n      data and present this reconciliation to policy-makers\n\n      For more information,\n      link to 'http://vista.cira.colostate.edu/improve/Default.htm'\n\n      [Summary provided by IMPROVE]",

This data will cover the period from the 16/17th c. to the present. The system will consist of a database coupled with a web-based interface performing the task of interaction with specially developed server-side modules, which pass queries to the database, and receive and present results to the user. The typical queries, which will require special modules, will be for instance, search for descendants or antecedents of a given person; or grouping of persons according to some criteria, such as given type of sanguineous marriage, economic specialisation, principles ruling the formation of households, etc.\nThe proposed system does not include any special client-side applications, since the information exchange with users will involve only already existing programmes. The result of a query will be presented to the user in one of the following standard formats at his/her option:\n1. ordinary, browser-independent web-page (HTML);\n2. CSV file, which is suitable for import into any spreadsheet application (MS Excel, OpenOffice.org Calc, etc.), or into specialised statistical packages (e.g. SPSS), as well as for transfer of data into another database system;\n3. GEDCOM, a standard format for exchange of genealogical data, suitable for use with such products as GenoPro for creation of visual representations and printing of genealogical data, and for processing with tools designed network analysis, e.g. Pajek or PGRAPH.\nThe participants of the project have already gathered considerable amount of personal demographic data pertaining to different peoples, territories and periods of time. We chose to use as model the data arrays on the Saami, Yugan Khanty, Mansi, several groups of Samoyed and Sayan-Altai Turkic peoples, and Uilta. Therefore, the already available materials pertain to the ethnic groups, which significantly vary in their economy, social organisation and history. The collected data originates from all types of historical and contemporary sources that are needed for development of the proposed information system. These arrays of data, being collected in different regions, not always cover the same periods of time. There are also chronological lacunae in some arrays due to the time framework of previous research programmes. Therefore, those lacunae will be filled with the results of field and archival research within the framework of this project.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=285",

The specific focus is to develop a quantitative understanding of the processes that are involved in Air-Surface Interactions and chemical exchange between the title reservoirs. As the nature and extent of snow and ice cover is changing, OASIS will assess the associated impact on, and by, climate change, and the human and ecosystem impacts of air-surface exchanges of chemical species.\nOASIS will quantify the impact of chemical, physical and biological exchange processes on tropospheric chemistry, the cryosphere, and the marine environment, and their feedback mechanisms in the context of a changing climate. OASIS has identified studies in the Arctic Ocean surface environment as a key programmatic component to reach these goals. IPY represents a unique opportunity to develop new initiatives that enable the community to do the best science, made possible by an international approach to logistics and experimentation. A legacy will be development and evaluation of new tools, implemented through a network of complex logistics, e.g. involving icebreakers, ice camps, piloted and unmanned vehicles in the atmosphere and ocean, satellite remote sensing, and computer models, to address the pressing scientific issues.\nThe OASIS program was established in 2003, and has developed an internationally vetted Science Plan, and an Implementation Plan, available at www.OASISHome.net. A growing number of individual projects are contributing to the scientific goals since winter 2004/05 (to date 45 individual projects, see 3.11 below). OASIS is linked to a number of international organizations and activities, including AMAP (the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program), and the IGBP (International Geosphere – Biosphere) programs IGAC (International Global Atmospheric Chemistry) under the AICI (Air Ice Chemical Interactions) activity, and SOLAS (Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study).\nDuring IPY (2007 – 2009), we propose to:\n1. Conduct coordinated icebreaker, ice camp, and aircraft studies of OASIS chemical exchange. A principal focus will be a nine-month coordinated campaign from the frozen-in icebreaker ‘m/v Antarctica’ and connected ice camps. Measurements will be made of a wide variety of chemical and biological compounds and physical properties in the Arctic marine boundary layer atmosphere, cryosphere and ocean. The impact on, and by, the physical state of the local environment will be a key topic of these studies. Shorter ice breaker campaigns (e.g. involving the Canadian “Amundsen” and the Russian ice-enforced RV 'Akademik Feodorov',and 'Mikhail Somov”) are also envisaged. This and connected aircraft work will be coordinated with other international IPY efforts.\n2. Establish a network of Arctic Ocean buoys that will enable year-round measurements of ozone and related chemical species. This work will fill major gaps in our knowledge of physical/chemical variables involved with Arctic Ocean surface ozone and mercury depletion and radiatively-active trace-gas budgets. The network will evolve in close cooperation with the International Arctic Buoy Project, the North Pole Environmental Observatory, and the proposed Arctic Ocean Observing System.\n3. Examine physical and chemical oceanographic variables that influence ocean-atmosphere chemical exchange, by observations of parameters in physical oceanography; marine biology; marine geology; sea ice characteristics; and hydrography using, among other tools, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as Below ice Environmental Laboratory.\nIn addition, not directly related to IPY, OASIS will:\n4. Conduct supporting laboratory studies of biological, chemical and physical processes relevant to snow, ice, gas, and aerosol phase photochemistry and chemical exchange.\n5. Develop and apply 1D and 3D models of OASIS exchange and associated atmospheric chemistry and cloud physics impacts, in association with scientists involved with 1-3 above.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=38",

Anthropogenic emissions could be the largest source of uncertainty in the global carbon budget as OCO-3 measurements reduce uncertainty of natural fluxes. OCO-3 has the ability to makes measurements at different times of the day.\nOCO-3 measurements can be combined with evapotranspiration and biomass measurements, such as those from other ISS instruments ECOSTRESS and GEDI, to study process details of the terrestrial ecosystem.\nOCO-2 has demonstrated that atmospheric XCO2 can be measured from space with precision of better than 1 ppm. OCO-3 is expected to have similar performance.\n\nMore Information: https://ocov3.jpl.nasa.gov/",

It can be difficult to parse through a multidecadal dataset such as MERRA-2 to evaluate the interannual variability of weather that occurs on a daily timescale, let alone determine the occurrence of an extreme weather event. Furthermore, it was recognized that standard metrics were needed to evaluate climate change among climate models and international research efforts. As a result of these concerns, the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) developed a set of indices that represent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events using a daily time series of 2-m air temperature (T2m) and precipitation (Alexander et al., 2016). These indices were used as a basis to comprise a list of fields that represent daily extreme temperature and precipitation events, heatwaves, multi-day precipitation, as well monthly percentile statistics from the MERRA-2 dataset. Also included in this data product is a climatological long term mean and standard deviation representing the interannual variability on a monthly timescale.",

Observations of increasing precipitation, rising river flow, declining snow cover, and thawing permafrost indicate substantial changes to the Arctic hydrological cycle. Variations and changes in the Arctic hydrological cycle are likely to arise from a complex interplay between natural internal modes of climate variability and anthropogenic activity. Variations in atmospheric aerosol characteristics have the potential to modulate the Arctic hydrological cycle both directly through its impact on precipitation and also indirectly through its impact on temperature. Atmospheric aerosols influence the nucleation of cloud particles, which influences directly the cloud cover and precipitation processes, and hence forces variations in the river runoff, snow cover, permafrost, glacial accumulation, and surface temperature. Biomass burning in the northern forests, pollution aerosol, biogenic aerosol, and desert dust have been proposed as significant sources of Arctic aerosol. \n\nDuring the IPY, we will examine seasonal and regional variations, focusing on the North American Arctic and the Eurasian Arctic land regions. We will establish a multi-disciplinary observing network of atmospheric and surface hydrological observations, integrating existing observations (surface and satellite) and supplementing them with UAV measurements and enhanced surface observations during a special field campaign. Diagnostic and modeling studies will be conducted to document and understand the role of variations of aerosols in influencing variations of the Arctic hydrological cycle, towards predicting these variations and using these predictions in regional decision making. We will attempt to clarify the interactions between warming and variations in aerosol characteristics on the changing Arctic hydrological cycle.\n\nThe field measurements undertaken during the IPY will be placed in a broader context through the synthesis of recent field observations, regional model development efforts, historical data sets, and global model simulations to assess the current status and research required for substantially improved predictions of Arctic precipitation and an assessment of the role of aerosols in forcing variations in the arctic hydrological cycle. To address this goal, we will conduct the following:\ni) Statistical analysis of local precipitation variability in the selected basins for the past 50 years, and interpretation of this variability in the context of internal modes of climate variability, local topography, local measurements of aerosol optical depth, and proximity to local sources of air pollution. \nii) Application of a mesoscale model with sophisticated cloud microphysical processes to investigate the sensitivity of precipitation amount and phase to aerosol physical and chemical characteristics, to simulate the impact of biomass burning, pollution aerosol, volcanic aerosol, and desert dust.\niv) Application of winter/spring mesoscale simulations using varying aerosol characteristics to force the Catchment-based land Surface Model (CLSM) in the selected basins to assess the impact of aerosol variations on runoff, timing of snow melt, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and permafrost.\nv) Assessment of the potential for seasonal and subseasonal predictability of snow melt and permafrost thaw and the disappearance of the snow roads.",

IGOSS is\n      coordinated jointly by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic\n      Commission (IOC) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific\n      and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Meteorological\n      Organization (WMO), and consists of national facilities and\n      services provided by participating member countries who share\n      data for mutual benefit.\n\n      The IGOSS system consists of three components: the IGOSS\n      Observing System (IOS), the IGOSS Data Processing and Services\n      System (IDPSS) and the IGOSS Telecommunications Arrangements\n      (ITA). In the IOS, naval ships, research vessels, and merchant\n      ships in the Ships-of-Opportunity Programme (SOOP) along with\n      fixed and floating buoys transmit oceanographic data such as\n      subsurface temperature and salinity in near-real time. The IDPSS\n      consists of several types of national, specialized and world\n      data centres for processing and dissemination data and data\n      products. The backbone of the ITA is the Global\n      Telecommunication System (GTS) of the WMO. BATHY and TESAC data\n      reports are transmitted over the GTS with headers that\n      correspond to the nation which made the observation and placed\n      the data on the GTS. The principal of free and open data\n      exchange for all member states is accomplished through the GTS.\n\n      Through IGOSS, observations, analyses and predictions of\n      important ocean features are available to users on an\n      operational basis, normally within 30 days or less. Ocean\n      observations of temperature, salinity, sea level, and currents\n      have a wide range of applications to commercial fishing,\n      hydrobiology, marine exloration, disaster prevention, marine\n      pollution and ocean modeling. IGOSS-derived data are used for\n      both operational and research applications. The data are quality\n      controlled at sea, by member states who acquired the data and at\n      data centres where they are archived. Data monitoring is\n      performed on a routine basis by the IGOSS Operations\n      Co-ordinator and a series of Data Monitoring and Statistical\n      Reports are available by FTP and via e-mail on the internet.\n\n      The most notable success of processing and quality controlling\n      global sets of temperature and salinity data is the Global\n      Temperature Salinity Profile Programme (GTSPP) There are also\n      groups such as the Group of Experts on Communications and\n      Products(GE/C&P) and the Task Team on Quality Control of\n      Automated Systems (TT/QCAS) that are comprised of experts from\n      member states that evaluate existing and new technologies for\n      acquiring more and improved oceanographic data, review WMO codes\n      and code tables for transmitting the data, and provide guidance\n      on equipment problems and corrections.\n\n      IGOSS products are disseminated promptly through the GTS and by\n      radio, radio facsimile, and various electronic and hard copy\n      mail systems. The IGOSS Products Bulletin, established in 1991,\n      compiles and publishes IGOSS global and regional products as a\n      valuable service to the scientific community and international\n      programmes.\n\n      For more information, link to\n'http://ioc.unesco.org/igossweb/igoshome.htm'",

Three field studies were conducted by an international team of scientists collaborating as part of the Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation (ITCT) program, an activity of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP). Previous measurements have indicated that the transport of Asian emissions across the North Pacific Ocean influences the concentrations of trace tropospheric species over the Pacific and even the west coast of North America.\n\nFor more information see http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/projects/itct/2k2/ or \n\nParrish, D.D., et al.

Specific goals are 1) to increase the knowledge and understanding of polar issues at the pre-university level internationally, 2) to increase the student's interest for natural and social sciences for polar regions, 3) assist polar research by encouraging meaningful data collection and reports by pre-university groups, 4) to encourage and facilitate exchange and communication between the participants. \n\nThe target group are students aged ~13-18 worldwide. The material will cover all six IPY themes and relevant inter-disciplinary topics. The aim is to inspire pupils to seek information about the polar regions and to increase their understanding of polar issues, both for natural and social sciences. The pupils will be provided with links to resources and should work as scientists by combining background knowledge, scientific data, as well as national and international hands-on learning activities (for instance GLOBE protocols). The students will be provided with a web-based report-generating tool to generate scientific reports based on information and material from the scientific findings of IPY work and other polar factual resources. The pupils then assess and conclude on the basis of both the scientist's and their own findings. The IntSchool report-generating tools will be tailored for the specific IPY themes, but also for relevant inter-disciplinary topics covering natural and social sciences, relevant topics important for the local communities of the respective schools and from ongoing IPY projects. The report generator will utilize both existing resources on polar issues and new findings from the IPY projects as well as tools and hands-on educational activities made by various Organisation in different countries. An e-mail based technical help-desk service will be provided for the teachers. Guidelines on how to use these activities for polar issues will be provided and the scientific editors for the solution will be able to communicate with the students and give them feedback on their work. The participating schools will be encouraged to communicate and exchange experience by e-mail correspondence or other Internet communication tools. The IntSchool educational tool will give a key contribution to reaching IPY's overall educational goals, as well as contribute to the outreach and communication goals. \n\nAll support and technical solutions are based on extensive experience in designing and implementing such tools. This overall solution combines the experience, expertise and existing solutions from educational systems, scientific work and web-based solutions, developed and tested in several polar countries over the last decade, into a modern educational tool for IPY. The partners include institutions with extensive scientific knowledge on polar issues, pedagogic institutions with vast experience of hands-on and learning through doing education both in polar communities and internationally, and experts on the development of web-solutions for education. This will ensure:\n-Scientific and educational top expertise \n-Years of experience with hands-on education \n-Coverage of both polar regions and all IPY themes \n-Technical detailed experience and knowledge on building and hosting the solution.",

Doing so will elucidate the supply of micronutrients to phytoplankton, contaminant dispersal in the ocean, and tracers of past and present ocean conditions. This initiative is prompted by the increasing recognition that TEIs are playing a crucial role as regulators and recorders of important biogeochemical and physical processes that control the structure and productivity of marine ecosystems, the dispersion of contaminants in the marine environment, the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and global climate. The primary objectives for the global GEOTRACES program are: •Determine global ocean distributions of selected TEIs •Evaluate the oceanic sources, sinks, and internal cycling of these TEIs and thereby characterize more completely their global biogeochemical cycles •Provide a baseline distribution as reference for assessing past and future changes. Specific objectives for polar GEOTRACES research include: •Characterize sources, sinks and internal cycling of trace elements that serve as essential micronutrients, including sources of material delivered to the ocean by rivers (primarily Arctic) and by glacial weathering (primarily Antarctic) of adjacent land masses •In collaboration with companion IPY initiatives, establish the role of micronutrient trace elements in regulating the structure and variability of polar marine ecosystems, with implications for interests ranging from fisheries (primarily Arctic) to the ocean-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide (primarily Southern Ocean). The IPY offers the opportunity to obtain synoptic TEI distributions among all major Polar ocean basins. The strong projects that have been proposed for the synoptic studies (Arctic and Antarctic) within IPY will offer the hydrographic and biological context that is needed for a robust interpretation of the TEI fields. Individual IPY – GEOTRACES proposals (EoIs) have been submitted to ICSU to: •Make GEOTRACES part of the synoptic studies planned for the polar oceans •Arctic: join forces with SNAPSHOT, SPACE, SEARCH and CARE, under the coordination of iAOOS, to achieve a detailed picture and improved understanding on the distribution of trace elements and their isotopes along - shelf-deep basin sections - sections across major pathways of Arctic ocean circulation •Southern Ocean: join forces with complementary IPY projects in physical and biological oceanography to perform multiple transects. Present options are: - Three dedicated GEOTRACES sections across “chokepoints” constraining the flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current: (1) an international program (BONUS; on a French vessel) studying together the South African margin/upwelling effect on water masses and the GoodHope/CLIVAR section down to 50°S, 0°W, (2) an international program aboard the Polarstern (German research vessel) connecting with the BONUS transect along 0° W and also working across the Drake Passage, and (3) a US study south of New Zealand. - Ancillary meridional sections where micronutrient cycling can be studied within the context of other programs (e.g., SASSI, CLIVAR, SCACE) - Both dedicated and ancillary cruises would be coordinated under the CASO (Climate in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean) umbrella to maximize interdisciplinary benefits from Southern Ocean research during the IPY.\n\nInformation provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/details.php?id=269",

They would be responsible for being the link from their home countries national YSC's to the IPY YSC as well as working on international initiatives. The concept for national level YSC's would be based on the successful model already developed in Canada and approved by Canada's IPY Steering Committee. The national YSC represents youth engaged in all forms of research within a country from science to social science as well as youth with indigenous and arts backgrounds. Youth from all levels of education (from high school through to the post-doc stage) would work together to bring IPY to the youth of that country. Each regional committee would be responsible for outreach within their country while the IPY YSC as a whole would undertake projects such as: providing a link to enhance international collaborations between young leaders and researchers, mentorship programs between youth and IPY researchers, getting youth involved in IPY programs, providing a webpage resource where interested parties could find out more about polar opportunities, encouraging a stronger focus on polar regions and the issues facing these areas and working to build a crucial bridge between the often disjointed Arctic and Antarctic researchers.\n\nThe IPY YSC would go beyond the goals of individual national YSC's and focus on projects more global in scope such as:\n\n An International Youth Conference on the Poles (IYCP) that would take place during IPY (proposed for late August, 2008). This would bring together youth from a diverse set of backgrounds and nationalities to discuss the current issues facing our polar regions and their effects on the remainder of the planet, ways of addressing these issues and highlighting ongoing IPY research, especially research being undertaken by youth. Included within the conference would be break out sessions where youth could form policy recommendations, which would be brought forward to international bodies such as UNESCO, SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) and the Arctic Council. UNESCO has expressed interest in providing facilities for this conference.\n\n-In collaboration with International Heliophysical Year (IHY)-IPY's IGY-Gold Program, connecting youth to the previous generations of polar researchers. Youth would interview IGY participants for a fresh perspective on their experiences and develop these interviews into documentary or book form. \n\n-Establish an International YSC website focused on how to get youth involved. Include an education centre where youth can educate themselves about polar issues and then download materials to educate their peers and communities. The website would provide information on how youth can get directly involved in IPY projects (i.e. as graduate students, field assistants, volunteers, guest lecturers etc) and also provide guidance on how to get involved with the IPY YSC or how to form their own national committees.\n\n-Document youth opinions on what the legacy of IPY should be. This list would ultimately serve to check the progress of IPY as it continues to develop and at the conclusion of IPY in 2009 to help judge how successful the program has been.\n\n- A youth mentorship program in association with the Youth Science Foundation Canada (YSF). This would build on YSF's existing peer to peer mentoring program for high school aged youth, SMARTS (Student Mentorship Association Regarding Technology & Science). IPY YSC would aid YSF in extending this program first to include university level students and ultimately senior researchers and university professors. IPY YSC would also work to bring more polar expertise into this program.\n\n-Connect youth to the poles and to each other. Reach out to the youth of late high school to early college age who have not yet chosen, or, more importantly, have long ago decided against, science as career, including that large group of youth who worry about the planet but whom often dismiss science as irrelevant, unreliable, arrogant, useless. Act as a strong voice on polar issues. Utilize marketing strategies aimed at our generation to vocalize support for IPY. Connect internationally to members of our generation who are not currently aware of the many concerns and issues facing the poles and the impacts changes there will have on their lives. Build connections that would help erode the divide between research science and science education.",

            "definition": "Ice cores have contributed substantially to understanding climate change. They provide convincing evidence of large, abrupt climate changes, demonstrate links between greenhouse gases and climate, and show how humans have altered the atmosphere. However, there is a great deal more to learn. In 2004, representatives of all major ice coring nations agreed on a common agenda for the next decade. This agenda looks beyond established projects and includes coring over all available timescales, with highest feasible resolution. IPY provides an opportunity to launch this initiative. Other ice coring efforts, including some that are part of International Partnerships in Ice Coring (IPICS), are the subject of separate IPY submissions, as indicated below. IPICS-related events planned for IPY include:\n\n1. Searching for the longest possible ice core record. The oldest Antarctic ice core so far extends 800-900 kyr. Before this, Earth's climate had a 40 kyr glacial-interglacial periodicity. IPICS aims to find a 1.2 Myr record and help discover why the period changed. During IPY, initial survey work will occur as part of the TASTE-IDEA ice divides traverses, by French/Italian/Russian teams in the Dome C-North Vostok-Dome B region, by a Chinese team near Dome A, and by US-led radar and remote sensing teams. IPICS will collate results to recommend drilling sites.\n2. Initiation of coring to recover the last interglacial and older ice from Greenland. The last interglacial was probably warmer than the present and is an analogue for an anthropogenically-warmed world. We need to learn about the behaviour of climate and the Greenland ice sheet during times of warmer climate. The oldest reliable core only partly penetrates the last interglacial. Drilling in northwest Greenland would start, and possibly finish, in IPY. Danish, US, French, Japanese, UK, Swiss, Swedish, and German groups have expressed interest, and others are expected to join. Note that while this effort is part of the IPICS agenda, it also falls under IPY lead project # 561 (Greenland’s Ice Sheet – reactions to past and present climate change), which will lead IPY efforts related to this element of IPICS.\n3. Starting a detailed spatial network of deep and intermediate-depth Antarctic ice cores. The spatial pattern of change is key to climate dynamics. We have cores from central East Antarctica and from a few coastal regions, but additional data are needed from other key areas, including the northern part of Lake Vostok, coastal Antarctica, the Antarctic peninsula, and West Antarctica. New projects like the European drilling at Talos Dome (east Antarctica) will take place during IPY. These programs will provide a springboard for a larger effort to fully sample Antarctic spatial climate variability on all possible time scales.\n5. The WAIS Divide Ice Core. This West Antarctic ice core will produce the best climate record covering the past 100,000 years, including highly resolved histories of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and millennial and shorter time-scale climate change in Antarctica. The main drilling starts during IPY, in the 2007/2008 Antarctic field season.\n4. Late Holocene climate change. Future change can only be assessed in the context of natural climate variability. Highly resolved compilations of past global climate (timescale up to 2000 years) critically lack polar data. The SCAR project, ITASE, produced 250 cores that cover the last 250 years. Extending this time scale to the last millennium, and expanding the scope in the Arctic, are critical. IPY will engage all countries to complete work in Antarctica and continue the effort in the Arctic.\n6. SOFIA (Search for the Oldest Firn Interstitial Air). SOFIA aims to obtain firn air records spanning more than the last 150 years, encompassing much of the period from the industrial revolution to the present day. Large firn air samples are critical for understanding this period of atmospheric history as they allow measurements (of trace species or isotopic ratios) that are otherwise impossible with ice core samples.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=117",

In particular:\n\n(1) How do clouds, aerosols and atmospheric chemistry interact to force the Pan-Arctic surface energy balances and albedo-temperature feedback?\n\n(2) What is the relative role of tropospheric dynamics and stratospheric linkages in controlling the Arctic surface variability? \n\n(3) What portion of the recent changes in the Arctic weather and climate can be attributed to increases in anthropogenic sources?\n\n(4) How does the Arctic atmosphere interact with the rest of the Arctic (marine, cryospheric and terrestrial) system?\n\n(5) To answer these questions (and others), all of the available observational resources represented by surface and upper air network observations, intensive observatories, satellite observations, manned and unmanned airborne measurements, and focused field campaigns must be utilized. \n\nSpecific tasks will be undertaken to:\n\n* Coordinate the efforts at a number of atmospheric observatory sites that are year-round, intensive, permanent, and with sufficient infrastructure and personnel to operate sophisticated atmospheric instruments such as lidars and radars that can provide information for detailed process studies. \n\n* Integrate and where possible, co-locate sensors from distributed networks measuring parameters such as precipitation, atmospheric radiation, water vapour, aurora activity, ozone, chemistry/radio nuclides, fractional cloud cover, temperature, and winds. The intensive observatories will become super nodes in the network systems.\n\n* Promote and enhance campaign activities that provide opportunities to make atmospheric measurements in logistically difficult locations, especially over the Arctic Ocean and surrounding Seas which are typically data sparse for surface-based atmospheric measurements. Examples of intensive programs include the North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO  EoI 436), the Ocean-Atmosphere-Sea Ice-Snow pack (OASIS-IPY, Activity 38), and the Arctic Summer Cloud-Ocean Study (ASCOS, EoI 212).\n\n* Utilize and support innovative technologies, for instance unmanned aircraft such as the High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) UAV program, automated station technologies, and wind energy technologies (CAPWE, EoI 721). \n\n* Contribute observational products to modelling efforts such as POLARCAT (Activity 32).\n\n* Contribute to defining the atmospheric component of larger, interdisciplinary Arctic observation coordination programs proposed for IPY such as Coordination of Observation and Monitoring of the Arctic for Assessment and Research (COMAAR  EoI 503). \n\nThe primary intention of this proposal will be to develop a legacy of continuous measurements of the Arctic atmosphere that will be combined with additional measurements from episodic, focused, campaigns. The goal will be to have sufficient understanding to determine relative contributions of natural versus anthropogenic forces in shaping the nature of the Arctic atmosphere. This activity will additionally contribute to an evaluation of the resulting impacts on the larger Arctic physical and biological system, as well as assess the impacts of Arctic atmospheric issues on global climate/weather.\n\nA particular emphasis will be to promote and integrate the activities of about five major, intensive, and permanent, observatories. This element will be responsive to a number of international assessments (e.g. IPCC, ACIA, AMAP) and research programs (WCRP, CliC, GEWEX and SEARCH) that have recommended that multi-disciplinary super-sites be developed to collect the information needed to determine the processes and drivers of environmental Arctic change across disciplines. \n\nAn action item for this proposal will be to establish an active coordination committee that will develop plans to leverage individual efforts by information exchange, standardization of measurement practices, cooperative use of resources, and data exchanges. Scientific collaborations will be promoted between institutions, programs, and nations to produce a comprehensive understanding of the atmosphere in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.",

This product has appealed to a variety of audiences: social scientists, climate change researchers, indigenous communities, cryospheric scientists, K-12 educators, and the general public. The popularity of this product and Dr. Gearheard's extensive research inspired the collaboration between the CU Museum and NSIDC.\n\nWe plan to create a temporary 'Inuit Voices' exhibit to be displayed at the CU Museum, and also two sets of travelling exhibits, one in English for the US and one translated into Inuktitut for Nunavut, Canada. Traveling museum exhibits are an effective and creative way to expose a wide range of audiences to information and perspectives from various world cultures. The exhibit size will be suitable for display in small museums, tribal colleges and libraries with limited space and budgets. \n\nThe exhibit will display the Uggianaqtuq CD-ROM and allow visitors to interact with the data and information it contains.

The operational phase of ISCCP began in July\n            1983 and is currently planned to continue through June 2000.\n             \n            Global coverage for ISCCP is provided by the five geostationary meteorological satellites (GOES-EAST, GOES-WEST, GMS, INSAT, and METEOSAT) and at least one polar orbiting NOAA satellite.  The primary data are from the two standard visible (0.6 micrometers) and infrared (11 micrometers) channels common to all of the satellites.  The polar orbiter provides coverage of the polar regions not viewed by the geostationary satellites and is used as a basis for normalization of the radiances observed by the different geostationary satellites.\n            \n            The strategy adopted for implementing ISCCP reflects the diverse nature of the spaceborne observing system and the large volume of imaging and other correlative data.  The primary data processing is done by eight institutions: a Satellite Processing Center (SPC) for each satellite (nominally at least one polar orbiter and five geostationary satellites), the Satellite Calibration Center (SCC), and the Global Processing Center (GPC).  The SPC's task is to collect raw satellite image data and reduce its volume.  The SCC routinely receives special high resolution-image data from each of the SPCs.  These data are used to normalize the calibration of each geostationary satellite to the polar orbiter.  The resulting normalization coefficients are sent to the GPC to be used in data production.  The SPC sends the reduced image data to the GPC for further processing of the ISCCP B3 and C1/C2 data.\n            \n            In addition to the primary data processing centers, there are three other centers:  the Correlative Data Center of which a main function is to coordinate the delivery of other satellite and conventional data (correlative data) to the GPC for use in the cloud analysis, the ISCCP Central Archive (ICA), which is responsible for the archival of all data produced by ISCCP, and the EOSDIS Langley DAAC, which archives and distributes ISCCP B3, C1 and C2 data.\n            \n            Representatives of the following ISCCP Data Management Centers: SPC, SCC, GPC, Correlative Data Center, and ICA form the ISCCP Working Group on Data Management (WGDM) for the Joint Scientific Committee (JSC).  Scientific guidance is provided to the project by the International Radiation Commission  of IAMAP and by the JSC Working Group on Radiation Fluxes.  ISCCP B3 data are the primary global radiance data product used in the cloud analysis.  The ISCCP cloud analysis has three fundamental parts: cloud detection, radiative transfer model analysis, and statistical analysis.  The first part determines whether a particular radiance measurement is associated with cloudy or clear conditions.  The second part compares the measured radiances, together with other correlative information about the atmosphere and surface, to a radiative model to retrieve several cloud (and surface) parameters.  The third part accumulates spatial distribution information about the radiances and retrieved parameters to summarize the analysis, every 3 hours in C1 data and once per month in C2 data.\n            \n            The ISCCP C1 and C2, along with the previously unavailable CX data\n            products were made available in 1995.

Logistic courses of Astrolabe, make it possible to reach zones very little studied and to document them in order to include/understand the processes which explain the variations space-time of pCO2 with average scale in the southern oceanic areas. Data collected during these programs will be used as a basis to make estimates of the interannual variability and average variation (tendency) of flow Net of CO2 to the interface ocean-atmosphere; an extention of this program was required (realization of some hydrographic stations average depths during one of rotations), which will make it possible to apprehend calculation by various methods of the CO2 signal anthropic which penetrates in the ocean in this southern sector. By identifying and quantifying CO2 sources and sinks, observations collected at the time of campaigns MINERVE are also used to other teams to force atmospheric models and to validate biogeochemical models based on models of oceanic circulation general which try to simulate the cycle of oceanic carbon in the medium and long term.\n\nSummary provided by http://soon.ipsl.jussieu.fr/en/CARAUS/MINERVE/Objectives.htm",

The Working Group became a Working Committee in 1973 through Resolution VIII-31, adopted by the 8th Session of the IOC Assembly (5-17 November 1973). \n\nThe IODE system forms a worldwide service oriented network consisting of DNAs (Designated National Agencies), NODCs (National Oceanographic Data Centres), RNODCs (Responsible National Oceanographic Data Centres) and WDCs (World Data Centres  Oceanography). During the past 40 years, IOC Member States have established over 60 oceanographic data centres in as many countries.\nThis network has been able to collect, control the quality of, and archive millions of ocean observations, and makes these available to Member States. \n\nWith the advance of oceanography from a science dealing mostly with local processes to one that is also studying ocean basin and global processes, researchers depend critically on the availability of an international exchange system to provide data and information from all available sources. Additionally, scientists studying local processes benefit substantially from access to data collected by other Member States in their area of interest. The economic benefit of obtaining data by exchange as opposed to collecting it oneself is huge. \nThe main objectives of the IODE Programme are : \n\n(i) to facilitate and promote the exchange of all marine data and information including metadata, products and information in real-time, near real time and delayed mode; \n\n(ii) to ensure the long term archival, management and services of all marine data and information; \n\n(iii) to promote the use of international standards, and develop or help in the development of standards and methods for the global exchange of marine data and information, using the most appropriate information management and information technology; \n\n(iv) to assist Member States to acquire the necessary capacity to manage marine data and information and become partners in the IODE network; and \n\n(v) to support international scientific and operational marine programmes of IOC and WMO and their sponsor organisations with advice and data management services. \n\nInformation provided by http://www.iode.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2&Itemid=34",

It will be held early on (Fall 2007) in the IPY timeframe, and will therefore be able to serve as a guiding tool to subsequent IPY Arctic initiatives.\n\nIndigenous observations are the most regular and ground-based insight on the current status of Arctic environment and wildlife. Accordingly, the IFM will highlight the capacity of Indigenous Peoples to make a crucial contribution to the design and management of Arctic environmental monitoring. It will also raise awareness of Indigenous environmental issues and concerns within the Arctic scientific community, and consequently support the active involvement of Indigenous Peoples in research that directly affects their communities and well-being. In that regards, the participation of Inuit elders in the recent United Nations climate change conference (CoP11) in Montreal highlights the unique and invaluable contribution that Indigenous Peoples observations, knowledge and experiences can bring to debates on the Arctic environment.\n\nThis Indigenous-led project will actively engage members of Northern communities in defining common monitoring challenges. In doing so, the IFM will not attempt to integrate components of Indigenous knowledge into science, but will instead aim to identify how the capacity, needs and viewpoints of circumpolar Indigenous Peoples can steer environmental monitoring work conducted in the Arctic and shape related decision-making processes.\n\nBy bringing together Indigenous elders, environmental practitioners, land managers and youth, the IFM will paint a comprehensive picture of the ability of Northerners to identify and respond to changes in their environment. The IFM's circumpolar linkages, supplemented by insight from the Pacific, will emphasize the human dimension of environmental change on Indigenous Peoples, and consequently the importance of environmental monitoring in the Arctic. The participation of social and natural science researchers in the IFM will also encourage the establishment of respectful connections between the holders of science-based and community-based knowledge.\n\nThe IFM will blend keynote speeches, roundtables and workshops in order to adequately address issues revolving around topics such as Indigenous knowledge, the continuation of cultural practices and livelihoods, participatory research, observational capacity and monitoring needs, and community-based monitoring.\n\nMore specifically, the insight of EoI ID No 100 will be sought in relation to monitoring needs on Indigenous lands, whereas the environmental baseline focus of EoI 496 will enhance discussions on observational capacity. Likewise, EoI 520 will bring legal expertise to debates surrounding Indigenous knowledge, EoI 922 will expand the IFM's coverage of community-based monitoring, EoI 503 will facilitate IFM's integration into the circumpolar observation and monitoring network, and EoI 1054 will strengthen the IFM's link to the Small Island Developing States. The IFM will draw from EoI 773's long-term ecosystem-based approach a means to merge scientific and Indigenous outlooks on the environment. Finally, the work of EoI 515 will help to illustrate how Indigenous environmental monitoring can influence governmental decision-making processes. \n\nThe IFM will be held in concert with Northern Youth Abroad's youth policy forum (full proposal ID No 184), and as such will both provide an opportunity for, and be enhanced by, the involvement of northern youth.",

The infestation is present in eight California counties,\nand is particularly severe in Napa and Sonoma Counties where thousands\nof acres of premiere vineyards have already been destroyed or are\nscheduled for future replacement.\n\n      Approach:\n\nDuring the 1993-1995 time period, NASA Ames Research Center (Ecosystem\nScience and Technology Branch) collaborated with industry and\nuniversity partners to develop and transfer the use of remote sensing\nand associated computerized technologies as a tool for vineyard\nmanagers to use in addressing the phylloxera problem. NASA's partners\non this project included the University of California Cooperative\nExtension (Napa County), University of California Davis (Entomology\nDept.), California State University Chico (School of Agriculture) and\nthe Robert Mondavi Winery. Staff from each organization brought unique\nexpertise to the project, working together in the field, laboratory\nand computer room. The work was co-funded by NASA's Office of Advanced\nConcepts and Technology and the Robert Mondavi Winery. Project results\nare being made available to the wine industry, commercial remote\nsensing product vendors, agricultural community and general public\nthrough invited oral presentations!  and written reports.  The\ntypically rapid progression of phylloxera infestation was\ncharacterized for the 1989-1993 time period across a ~1000 acre\nMondavi property using retrospective color infrared aerial\nphotography.\n\nDuring the 1993 growing season, field and aircraft data were collected\nfrom Napa Valley test sites with special sensors designed to study\nearth resources, including plant stress manifested as reductions in\nvegetation canopy density. Infestations are detectable in this\nremotely sensed imagery, even in the early stage when phylloxera are\nunderground eating vine roots but the above ground plant still appears\nhealthy.\n\n      Significance:\n\nBy using remote sensing and associated analysis techniques, growers\ncan attain earlier knowledge on the rate of spread of the infestation,\nand the rate of decline for affected vines. It is anticipated that\nthis source of information will allow for more informed replanting\ndecisions, helping California wineries retain market share.\n\nFor more information, link to 'http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/grapes/grapes.html'",

The new data led to the radical revision of traditional views on the initial human dispersal and adaptations in High Latitudes. The schemes presented and repeated in manuals and textbooks are essential wrong and outdated. In spite of the unprecedented scale of field activity in different portions of this vast area, the projects are conducted by the individual and occasionally isolated regional research groups. It hampers the co-operation of scholars and coordination between field and laboratory research. To address these challenges during the International Polar Year, we have developed a new research programme known as ICOL - the Initial Human Colonization of Arctic in Changing Palaeoenvironments. Only by integrating results from archaeological and palaeoenvironmental studies will it be possible to develop a comprehensive understanding of Early Man dispersal and adaptations in extremely harsh conditions of Arctic and Subarctic. The territory of the Northern Eurasia is of prime importance for the comparative study of early human dispersal and adaptations. The glacial activity during the Late Pleistocene in this part of world was restricted (comparing with northern part of North America and some portions of the Southern Hemisphere occupied by giant glacial sheets) and vast areas allowed the rapid human dispersal. Moreover, this territory played a key role in human colonization of the Western Hemisphere via Beringia. The comprehensive studies of man-land relationships in the Upper Paleolithic will be carried out in several regions of the Eastern portion of the European Russia, the territories lying near the Ural Mountains and the Pechora River basin (Byzovaya, Garchi, Zaozerye and Mamontova Kurya), as well as in Eastern Siberia (the Yana RHS site). The study of the Early Man in the New World is of particular interest connected with the complicated history of the Bering Land Bridge. In this connection the study of the muliticomponent site of Broken Mammoth (interior Alaska) is of crucial importance. The study of late human penetration to High Latitudes in Holocene during the Ocean transgression is of no less importance. In this connection the Mesolithic and Neolithic sites located at the northern most part of Kola Peninsular, Novosibisk Islands (the Zhokhov Island site), Chukotka (the Tytyl and Elgygtgyn lake sites), and coastal north Greenland (Kap Ole Cheiwitz, Kolnaes) will be main targets of research. The study of hunter-gatherers subsistence and adaptations will be supplemented by palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, including the studies of glacial activity, permafrost, vegetation and fauna. The starting points of migrated populations, possible migration routes and time will be defined. The chronological framework of the project will embrace different epochs from the Eemian Interglacial (phase 5e) to the Holocene.",

These tiny particles, of about a millionth of a centimeter or smaller in diameter, scatter sunlight back to space and cause a regional cooling effect. These aerosols consisting of sulfates, soot, organic carbon and mineral dust are produced both naturally and by human activities. Results of numerous global warming models suggest that the aerosol cooling is one of the largest, if not the largest, sources of uncertainty in predicting future climate. Still, the complex influence of aerosol cooling on global warming is not clearly understood. This issue will remain a mystery unless field experiments, such as the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), are undertaken to collect in-situ data on the regional cooling effect of sulfate and other aerosols.\n\nINDOEX addresses questions of climate change that are of high priority and of great value to the US and the international community. The project&#039;s goal is to study natural and anthropogenic climate forcing by aerosols and feedbacks on regional and global climate. This issue is at the core of the International Global Change Research Program and has been identified by IPCC as a major gap in the science of climate change prediction. \n\nINDOEX field studies will occur where pristine air masses from the southern Indian Ocean including Antarctica and not-so-clean air from the Indian subcontinent meet over the tropical Indian Ocean to provide a unique natural laboratory for studying aerosols. Scientists will collect data from the water surface through the lower stratosphere, on the aerosol composition, reactive atmospheric gases, solar radiation fluxes, wind and water vapor distribution. To this end, investigators will use multiple aircraft, ships and island stations over the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. Building on data collected in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998, the intense field campaign will be undertaken during January to April, 1999. Field data will be used to calibrate the National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#039;s Earth Observing System instruments to obtain a regional map of the aerosol cooling effect. In conjunction with the regional scale satellite data, the field data will also be used to include aerosol effects in global warming prediction models.\n\nInformation provided by http://www-indoex.ucsd.edu/ProjDescription.html",

The following year, 1999, the remains of Kwaday Dan Tsinchi meaning Long Ago Person Found in Southern Tutchone (Athapaskan) were found melting out of a glacier in Tatshenshini-Alsek Park in adjacent northwestern British Columbia, Canada (Beattie et al.,, 2000, Canadian Journal of Archaeology 24:129-147). \nIn 1999, more artifacts and biological remains were found at other melting south Yukon ice patches. Within a few summer field seasons of research, significant specimens and samples (paleo-biological, or paleobiological and archaeological) were identified and/or collected from more than 70 mountain-top ice patches in the latter jurisdiction. Radiocarbon dating indicated that the frozen organic remains being recovered from the Yukon ice patch sites spanned the entire Holocene period (Farnell et al., 2004, Arctic 57-3:247-259. Hare et al., 2004, Arctic 57-3:260-272). \nThe banking and curation of the samples/specimens recovered as a result of the Yukon ice patch work has been coordinated by the Yukon Government (Renewable Resources, and Heritage-Archaeology) with local study and analysis of materials, as well as research and identification work by collaborating scientists from other institutions. Studies related to the ancient artifacts have included feather identification and analysis by staff of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington (Dove, et al., 2005, Arctic 58-1:38-43), and paint analysis by staff of the Canadian Conservation Institute in Ottawa (Helwig et al., unpublished). Studies related to the biological specimens have been wide-ranging, including: research on species, particularly caribou, genetic history through mtDNA research; caribou dietary analysis; industrial contaminants analysis; parasite history; pollen and vegetation history; ice patch shrinkage over time; etc. (Farnell et al., ibid.).\nThe Kwaday Dan Tsinchi project is also locally administered, with the concerned indigenous government, the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, jointly managing the project with the province. The provincial museum (Royal British Columbia Museum), the Provincial Parks department, as well as scientists based in Canada, Germany, and Scotland are working with the community on the study and interpretation of this find, and the materials recovered there-from, with results now being published (e.g., Monsalve et al., 2002, American Journal of Physical Anthropology 119-3:288-291; Dickson et al., 2004, Holocene 14-4:481-486; Mudie et al., 2005, Canadian Journal of Botany 83:111-123; Richards et al., in press, American Antiquity). Both the discovery and the manner in which this unique find is being managed continue to receive international attention; the project is often pointed out as an example of how scientists and First Nations can work together on even the most sensitive of subject areas, human remains. \nColleagues began fieldwork in adjacent Alaska in 2001, continuing in 2003, attempting to find glacier or ice patch archaeological sites in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. This work involved the development of a predictive model for identifying locations that should be targeted in the search for archaeological and/or biological specimens in these frozen landscapes (Dixon et al., 2005, American Antiquity 70-1:129-143). In 2003, state archaeologists successfully identified ice patch archaeological sites in the Tangle Lakes (Denali Highway) area of the state (Vanderhoek et al., in press, Alaska Journal of Anthropology). Fieldwork has continued in this location and elsewhere in the state, with ongoing analysis of the recovered materials.\nThe identification of ice patch sites yielding biological and cultural specimens and samples began in the Mackenzie Mountains region of Northwest Territories, Canada in 2005, with positive results (Andrews, 2005 communication to Activity leader). Plans are underway to search for ice patch sites in the Atlin area of northern British Columbia, Canada in 2006 (French, 2005 communication to Activity leader). Archaeological survey to search for specimens melting out of glaciers in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska, U.S. is also to be initiated in 2006 (Howell, 2005 communication to Activity leader).\nFieldwork to find and recover the specimens and samples melting out of the glaciers and ice patches in northwestern North America, as well as to study the melting phenomena themselves, takes place during the height of the summer melt season each August. The fieldwork is generally conducted as day trips or short excursions, relying on helicopters for logistic support; over-view (fixed wing) flights have also been found to be useful. \nThe materials being recovered from these frozen contexts include ancient artifacts, biological materials such as small bird and animal remains, dung from different species but predominantly caribou in the case of the ice patch sites, plant macro and micro remains, and ice block samples. The specimens collected are often fragile and following field documentation, in many cases must be quickly transferred to refrigerated storage to prevent deterioration. After recovery, the specimens and samples are curated in local government facilities whenever possible; professional Conservators are stabilizing the more fragile and significant artifact pieces. Laboratory work to study both the biological and archaeological specimens and samples recovered during these projects is being undertaking by government researchers based in the north, where-ever possible, working in collaboration with scientists/specialists at southern institutions. \nThe local communities are involved, as well, in the study and interpretation of the recovered materials. For example, funds are being sought to document traditional indigenous knowledge related to the unique archaeological finds being collected by the Yukon Ice Patch project. Research to document the traditional aboriginal use of these landscapes is also part of the some of the projects. Museum displays on some of the finds are already in place, e.g., Kwaday Dan Tsinchi at the Royal British Columbia Museum, and more are in the works.",

This activity is a crucial part of IPY data management. Providing searchable metadata for IPY publications is as important as providing searchable metadata for IPY datasets. The IPY Publications Database is essential for the identification, dissemination and preservation of the achievements of the IPY. Twenty years from now, when someone asks, 'What did the IPY accomplish?'.  The IPY Publications Database will provide a major part of the answer. As described in later sections of this proposal, the IPY Publications Database will also make a significant contribution to achieving the legacy, education, outreach and communication targets of the IPY.\n\nThe IPY Publications Database will be created by an expansion of the existing polar bibliographic infrastructure. The Cold Regions Bibliography Project (CRBP) at the American Geological Institute currently produces the Bibliography on Cold Regions Science and Technology and the Antarctic Bibliography. The Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) Library at the University of Cambridge produces the SPRILIB database and assists the CRBP with the Antarctic Bibliography. The Arctic Science and Technology Information System (ASTIS) at the Arctic Institute of North America, University of Calgary, produces the ASTIS database. All of these databases, and others, are combined by National Information Services Corporation (NISC) to produce the Arctic & Antarctic Regions (AAR) database describing more than one million polar publications.\n\nThe IPY Publications Database will be created by dividing responsibility for the coverage of IPY publications between the CRBP, the SPRI Library and ASTIS; by using the IPY Data Policy to ensure that all IPY publications are reported to at least one of these organizations; by obtaining funding that allows these organizations to index the increased number of polar publications that will result from the IPY; and by having NISC include the resulting bibliographic records in both the AAR database and a new free IPY Publications Database. Bibliographic records (metadata) for IPY publications will include citations, detailed subject and geographic indexing terms, and, in most cases, abstracts. Most IPY publications will be available online, and the records describing IPY publications will contain DOIs or URLs linking to the full-text of the publications.\n\nWith the IPY Joint Committee support for this proposal, the members of the consortium are confident that they can obtain the necessary funding for this activity. At the peak of IPY indexing, which will occur two to four years after the IPY observation years, the amount of new money required may be about 10% of the consortium members' normal budgets. Raising this amount of additional money should be quite feasible. In the unlikely event that sufficient new money cannot be obtained, the members of the consortium will index as many IPY publications as possible themselves, and will encourage other members of the Polar Libraries Colloquy (the international organization of polar libraries and databases) to help fill any gaps.\n\nProviding access to the publications that result from the IPY is just as important as providing access to other types of IPY data. The IPY Publications Database will ensure that IPY publications are identified and made accessible.",

            "definition": "Ice cores provide information about past climate and environmental conditions on timescales from decades to hundreds of millennia, and direct records of the composition of the atmosphere. As such, they are cornerstones of global change research. For example, ice cores play a central role in showing how closely climate and greenhouse gas concentrations were linked in the past, and in demonstrating that very abrupt climate switches can occur.\n\nWith the completion of major projects in Greenland and Antarctica over the last 15 years, the international ice coring community is planning for the next several decades. The costs and scope of future work create the need for coordinated international collaboration. Developing this international collaboration is the charge of IPICS, the International Partnerships in Ice Core Sciences, a planning group currently composed of ice core scientists, engineers, and drillers from 18 nations. IPICS is supported by PAGES (Past Global Changes), SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) and IACS (International Association of Cryospheric Sciences), although it is not a formal project under any of these organizations.\n\nTwo international meetings in 2004 and 2005 (Brook, E. and Wolff, E.W., The future of ice core science, EOS, 87 (4), p. 39. 2006) lead to an ambitious four-element framework that both extends the ice core record in time and enhances spatial resolution. The scientific goals and their implementation have been outlined in the four IPICS White Papers - available from the IPICS website.\n\nShort Title: IPICS\nProject URL: http://www.pages-igbp.org/ipics/Proposal URL:http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=117\n\nIPICS-related events planned for IPY include:\n\n1. Searching for the longest possible ice core record. The oldest Antarctic ice core so far extends 800-900 kyr. Before this, Earth's climate had a 40 kyr glacial-interglacial periodicity. IPICS aims to find a 1.2 Myr record and help discover why the period changed. During IPY, initial survey work will occur as part of the TASTE-IDEA ice divides traverses, by French/Italian/Russian teams in the Dome C-North Vostok-Dome B region, by a Chinese team near Dome A, and by US-led radar and remote sensing teams. IPICS will collate results to recommend drilling sites.\n\n2. Initiation of coring to recover the last interglacial and older ice from Greenland. The last interglacial was probably warmer than the present and is an analogue for an anthropogenically-warmed world. We need to learn about the behaviour of climate and the Greenland ice sheet during times of warmer climate. The oldest reliable core only partly penetrates the last interglacial. Drilling in northwest Greenland would start, and possibly finish, in IPY. Danish, US, French, Japanese, UK, Swiss, Swedish, and German groups have expressed interest, and others are expected to join. Note that while this effort is part of the IPICS agenda, it also falls under IPY lead project # 561 (Greenland's Ice Sheet - reactions to past and present climate change), which will lead IPY efforts related to this element of IPICS. \n\n3. Starting a detailed spatial network of deep and intermediate-depth Antarctic ice cores. The spatial pattern of change is key to climate dynamics. We have cores from central East Antarctica and from a few coastal regions, but additional data are needed from other key areas, including the northern part of Lake Vostok, coastal Antarctica, the Antarctic peninsula, and West Antarctica. New projects like the European drilling at Talos Dome (east Antarctica) will take place during IPY. These programs will provide a springboard for a larger effort to fully sample Antarctic spatial climate variability on all possible time scales. \n\n5. The WAIS Divide Ice Core. This West Antarctic ice core will produce the best climate record covering the past 100,000 years, including highly resolved histories of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and millennial and shorter time-scale climate change in Antarctica. The main drilling starts during IPY, in the 2007/2008 Antarctic field season.\n\n4. Late Holocene climate change. Future change can only be assessed in the context of natural climate variability. Highly resolved compilations of past global climate (timescale up to 2000 years) critically lack polar data. The SCAR project, ITASE, produced 250 cores that cover the last 250 years. Extending this time scale to the last millennium, and expanding the scope in the Arctic, are critical. IPY will engage all countries to complete work in Antarctica and continue the effort in the Arctic.\n\n6. SOFIA (Search for the Oldest Firn Interstitial Air). SOFIA aims to obtain firn air records spanning more than the last 150 years, encompassing much of the period from the industrial revolution to the present day. Large firn air samples are critical for understanding this period of atmospheric history as they allow measurements (of trace species or isotopic ratios) that are otherwise impossible with ice core samples.",

These are required to improve understanding of the behaviour of the atmosphere and its interactions with the oceans and the biosphere and will enable prediction of the future states of the earth-atmosphere system. GAW was established in 1989 as a coordinated system of networks of observing stations some of which began data-gathering in the 1950s and includes associated facilities and infrastructure encompassing measurement and related scientific assessment activities. The overall role of GAW is to supply basic information of known quality indicative of the atmospheric environment that transcends specific issues. The measurement programme includes: greenhouse gases, ozone (surface, total, and profile), radiation (including UV-B) and optical depth, precipitation chemistry, chemical and physical properties of aerosols, reactive gases, radionuclides, and related meteorological parameters. National and international policy decisions affecting the environment in the 21st century will thus rely heavily on the scientific data gathered through GAW. GAW is an integral part of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) consisting of global stations located at remote pristine locations and regional stations for characterizing the regional environmental quality away from direct pollution sources. Also established are WMO World Data Centres for ozone and UV-B, radiation, aerosol optical depth, precipitation chemistry, greenhouse gases and all atmospheric gases except ozone, and aerosols. A concept of Quality Assurance/Science Activity Centres serves as a crucial link between the individual sampling sites - where the parameters are measured - and the ultimate data depositories (Data Centres) where the quality-assured data are archived and distributed.\n\nFor more information see:\nhttp://www.wmo.ch/web/arep/gaw/gaw_home.html",

The study involves two field seasons, the first of\n which was completed in 1998-1999. This field season (2000-2001)\n will be the second and last for this project. The study, which\n includes 10 principal and senior investigators at five\n institutions, with seven additional contributing investigators,\n has two broad-based goals: to improve substantially our current\n understanding of the oxidation chemistry of bioorganic sulfur\n in the polar environment, and to improve the climatic\n interpretation of sulfur-based signals in Antarctic ice-core\n records.\n\n The South Pole was selected because the atmospheric boundary\n layer at this site presents a homogeneous and relatively simple\n environment from which to unravel the photochemically driven\n oxidation chemistry of dimethyl sulfide. Atmospheric sulfur\n chemistry is an important component in climate change issues\n because both naturally (i.e., from volcanic emissions and\n oceanic phytoplankton production) and anthropogenically emitted\n sulfur compounds form minute particles in the atmosphere--the\n so-called aerosols--that reflect solar radiation, produce\n atmospheric haze and acid rain, and affect ozone\n depletion. Sulfate particles in the atmosphere may also act as\n condensation nuclei for water vapor and enhance global\n cloudiness. On the millennial time scale, the variability and\n natural background level of atmospheric aerosols can be\n reconstructed from the preserved paleorecords of sulfur\n oxidation products in ice cores. It is necessary, however, to\n understand how the physical and chemi!  cal environment of the\n oxidation process affects the relative concentrations of the\n oxidation products that become buried in the ice. This study\n requires simultaneous observations of a wide-ranging suite of\n sulfur species, such as DMS and its oxidation products, sulfur\n dioxide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfone, methane sulfonic\n acid, and sulfuric acid, as well as photochemically important\n compounds such as carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, water vapor,\n and non-methane hydrocarbons.\n\nSecondary objectives will be:\n\nto examine interior Antarctic air samples for other significant\nDMS oxidation products, such as sulfurous acid and methane\nsulfonic acid; and to assess the local variation in hydroxyl and\nperhydroxyl radicals, a measure of the oxidizing power of the\natmosphere.  This study will provide, for the first time, a\nquantitative picture of exactly which atmospheric sulfur\ncompounds are advected into the Antarctic interior and a\ndetailed picture of the sulfur chemistry that is active in the\nAntarctic atmosphere.\n\nContact Information:\n\nDr. Douglas Davis, Principal Investigator\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\n221 Bobby Dodd Way\nAtlanta, GA 30332-0340\n\nPhone: 404-894-4008\nFax: 404-894-1993\nEmail: douglas.davis&#64eas.gatech.edu\n\nFor more information,\nlink to\n'http://rpsc.raytheon.com/science/SciPlanSummaries/sps00/00_OO_270_O.htm'\n\n[Summary provided by Raytheon]",

NPPthe net amount of solar energy converted to plant organic matter through photosynthesiscan be measured in units of elemental carbon and represents the primary food energy source for the world&#039;s ecosystems. Human appropriation of net primary productivity (HANPP), through the consumption of food, paper, wood and fiber, alters the composition of the atmosphere, levels of biodiversity, energy flows within food webs and the provision of important ecosystem services.

            "definition": "In the present project a team of researchers from six nations will study the history and legacy of IPY through its field stations. (For a more full-bodied description of our approach and themes of study, see EoI 686, January 2005.)\nField stations have been one of the most salient and tangible features of IPYs since 1882-83 and through to the coming IPY 2007-08. The polar station is a modern feature, the smaller field cousin of the Laboratory, Instrument, or Observatory. It is a nexus, and a place, where a number of central features of the modern scientific enterprise – laboratory practices and methods, precision instruments, territorial claims – meet in the landscape and sometimes in close vicinity of local groups and populations. Field stations, and the scientific expeditions that created them and used them as vantage points, are inseparable from polar research. They form important parts of the infrastructure of polar research in the past two centuries. They have also served as flag carriers, and as symbols of political, diplomatic and economic ambitions of the nations to which their founders belonged.\nHowever, field stations remain a surprisingly neglected element in the study of the creation of scientific knowledge, and in relation to science diplomacy and geopolitical conflict and cooperation. We know quite little of the bipolar archipelagoes of IPY stations and their significance, some of them more than a century old. We are yet not sufficiently clear about their status as legacies of past ambitions, or as heritage in landscapes which were shared by science with local groups and indigenous peoples.\nIn this project we will approach field stations from a range of disciplinary vantage points. At the heart of our concerns are field stations as units of knowledge production in the field. This is particularly pertinent to the IPY legacy. Cooperation in sharing field data is an ideal that has run through previous IPYs, and it has been given special prominence in the IPY 2007-2008 Framework. The original idea of IPY emerged from a recognition that individual studies in the field sciences only contribute to a larger picture with a great deal of work. Field stations are one of the chief means by which a sustained presence in the field is maintained: field sites, instruments, and the movement of personnel are carefully coordinated; projects are vetted within research communities through systems of peer review; research efforts are directed with an eye to agendas decided by policymakers. Another thing is the way that contact and collaboration between researchers and disciplines is influenced by the specifics of the field station, including management practices and physical design, which evidently has significant implications for field stations and knowledge production.\nIn the project we intend to use the International Polar Year 2007-2008 as an opportunity to identify and analyse the work (e.g. planning, calibrating, publishing, management, hidden labour, sharing data) required to make field observations meaningful across a range of scales and contexts of users or audiences. The IPY 2007-08 represents a singular opportunity to understand how the field sciences have generated a scientific and cultural legacy. We will analyse former and present research station sites, including important non-IPY sites, to understand how the residues of scientific practice become valid knowledge, collective memory and heritage. We will also study the contemporary and past role of field-stations in establishing patterns of management-labour interactions, work rules and customs, and attitudes toward jobs, for modern, non-subsistence employment in communities which have hosted or interacted with stations. For some stations, only archival work is possible.\nAmong a range of IPY proposals which are in different ways connected to this one (see further under 3.2), our project links up in particular with the LASHIPA project (EoI 636). LASHIPA studies industrial, mining, and whaling stations and sites in the polar regions, some of which are also related to IPY history. In this way the “station” comes out not just as the site of different forms of production (of knowledge, goods, and perceptions), but also as a theoretical concept: the physical manifestation of Western knowledge and its specific relationships of nature and culture, time and place, the physical and the spiritual. In combination, the two projects (686 and 636) provide a comprehensive and novel approach to the geography of human presence and IPY encounters in the Arctic and Antarctic regions.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=100",

We have developed a method for calculating mass-balance changes by combining ice-sheet average time-series from AOGCM projections for future centuries, both with information from high-resolution climate models run for short periods and with a 20 km ice-sheet mass-balance model. Antarctica contributes negatively to sea level on account of increased accumulation, while Greenland contributes positively because ablation increases more rapidly. The uncertainty in the results is about 20% for Antarctica and 35% for Greenland. Changes in ice-sheet topography and dynamics are not included, but we discuss their possible effects. For an annual- and area-average warming exceeding  in Greenland and  in the global average, the net surface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet becomes negative, in which case it is likely that the ice sheet would eventually be eliminated, raising global-average sea level by 7 m.\n\nhttp://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1844/1709.full",

At the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), scientists have already demonstrated one GPS Meteorology technique using ground based GPS receivers.[1] 'Ground based GPS Meteorology is capable of accurate, continuous, integrated precipitable water vapor measurements at fixed sites. In the near future, a UCAR lead team intends to demonstrate an active limb sounding technique using radio occultation observations taken by an orbiting GPS receiver. We refer to this program and the technology under development collectively as 'GPS/MET'.\n      \nThe primary GPS/MET Program objectives are:\n(1) to construct a system and use it to collect GPS occultation data,\n      \n(2) to develop and demonstrate algorithms for the recovery of accurate refractivity profiles and derivative products, such as pressure, temperature and moisture profiles, (3) to evaluate the net impact of GPS/MET occultation data on weather forecasts and global change research, and (4) to publish GPS/MET data in forms useful to other scientists investigating meteorological and related applications.\n      \nNote that GPS/MET promises to produce high quality data for two of the key global change variables identified by the Committee on Earth and Environmental Sciences: atmospheric temperature and moisture distribution. Moreover, the goals for GPS/MET address specific objectives identified in NOAA's 1992 Strategic Plan for Upper- Air Observations. If successful, this proof- of- concept demonstration could pave the way for a new, low cost operational sounding system capable of thousands of globally distributed soundings per day.\n      \nTo achieve these objectives quickly and inexpensively, a modified commercial GPS receiver will be flown on a host satellite as a secondary payload. Launch of this satellite, the MicroLab-1, is scheduled for Fall, 1994. GPS occultation data, ancillary data taken from ground based observations, and derived information products will be published on the Internet beginning early 1995. To establish the predicted performance of the system, the GPS/MET team is conducting various tests and a detailed error analysis on the end- to- end system. Gridded data derived from operational observing systems will be used to validate GPS/MET data. Four Dimensional Data Assimilation (4DDA) software tools are under development for use in the assessment of the technique's net impact on weather forecasts.\n      \nThe GPS/MET Program is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additional support is being provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and two industrial corporations: Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) and Allen Osborne Associates, Inc. (AOA). The GPS/MET team includes researchers from UCAR's UNAVCO and NCAR/MMM divisions, and from the University of Arizona (U of AZ) and CalTech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).\n      \nFor more information, link to http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/gpsmet/index.html",

This compliments ground site observations and satellite data that can be synchronized in both space and time to record seasonal variations. Observations from the ISS offers an above the cloud vantage including wide angle oblique views, sun-glint textures, day-night terminator lighting, and perhaps most important, human guided observations that can fall outside the purview of pre-programmed field of view instrumentation. The ISS offers a unique platform for Antarctic atmospheric observations since it gives repeated coverage circumscribing the continent every few days where cloud cover the general lack of observation sites limits routine ground observations over long periods of time.\n \nWe propose to use the current observational equipment on ISS including a suite of digital still cameras, standard video cameras, and a medium resolution, fiber optic coupled visible region spectrograph. We are planning the fabrication for use on ISS of an IMAX-sized format, CCD camera optimised for low light level video if funding permits. With the NASA presidential directive for human exploration beyond Earth orbit, NASA is considering astronaut training in polar regions as analogues for human planetary missions. We propose to coordinate these polar analogue activities with ISS observations. \n\nParticipation in this proposal will be open to all international partners to ISS as well as any other project that wishes to coordinate observations with ISS. All ISS collected data will be archived and publicly distributed using current NASA infrastructure. This activity offers great potential for educational outreach by linking human exploration from Earth polar extremes to Earth orbital extremes to Lunar and Martian extremes. The outreach will use current NASA educational infrastructure. \n\nBackground\n\nThis proposal resulted from prior collaborations when the Lead Contact was a crewmember and Science Officer on Expedition 6 to ISS. During this expedition, synchronized aurora observations were made between ISS and ground observers in Finland. Observations of Antarctic PMC were routinely made and subsequently correlated with SNOE satellite data with collaborators from University of Colorado and University of Alaska. These efforts proved the utility of making synchronized observations between ISS, ground, and satellite and resulted in this proposal. This proposal has been submitted with the approval of Dr. Jim Garvin, NASA Chief Scientist, in the NASA Washington DC office.\n\nD. R. Pettit, D. W. Rusch, G. E. Thomas, A. Merkel, S. Bailey, J. M.

Griselin, France and EoI n° 233 (SUGLANET, presented by A. Eraso, Spain). The two teams worked together for a long time concerning Svalbard Hydrology and are linked by a convention between CNRS (French Scientific Research Center) and IPEV (French Polar Institute). The objective of this clustering project is to investigate the hydrology of polar and subpolar glacier basins. It is known that discharge of temperate glaciers (11.2 m3.s-1 km-2) is bigger than that coming from subpolar glaciers (0.20.3 m3.s-1 km-2), but also it is true that extension of subpolar glaciers (ca.750,000 km2) is 10 times bigger than that of temperate glaciers (ca.70,000 km2). By considering these data, the discharge of subpolar glaciers due to the global warming may be as important as those coming from temperate glaciers. However, the hydrological response of subpolar glaciers to atmospheric inputs is not well-know and may be precised by continuous monitoring of some parameters at key-locations on basins. New technologies in the fields of information and communication drastically increased the observation capacity of scientists. In very reactive environments such as polar regions, it is now possible to enhance qualitative and quantitative observations using automatic data collection sensor webs. The development of such networks is bringing new tools to answer hypothesis that were so far lacking a continuous database to be studied. Such is the situation of arctic hydro-systems for which the most data available over the last forty years are discontinuous, usually summer measurements. The originality of this program is to investigate the hydrology of glacier basins through continuous survey, over a period of several years, that is necessary to quantify the hydrosystems reactivity to climatic variations (hourly, daily, seasonally even yearly). Through this cluster, the dynamics of polar hydrology will be approached continuously at two different scales on 5 representative polar basins of Arctic (3) and Antarctic (2).\n\n1. At a local scale, a sensor-web will be developed on the Loven East glacier (Svalbard): this glacier is representative of the alpine type glaciers of Svalbard and is hydrologically studied by the French and by the Spanish scientists since 40 years. The goal is to analyze liquid and solid fluxes from this hydro-system with a sensor web (both remote and in situ sensing). An environmental watch will be conducted in this area over a three years period through a network of photographic stations, hydrological sensors and meteorological stations. All the ground data will be transmitted automatically thus contributing to set up a true sensor web. The database will allow a global approach of spatial and temporal dynamics of the Loven East hydrosystem. Field surveys will also be conducted regarding the different inputs to the system. Remote sensing data, aerial photographs, meteorological data and hydrological information will allow the quantification of the system reactivity to contemporary climatic fluctuations. Experimental pilot catchment areas will be implemented to register glacier discharge continuously, recordering time series with hourly cycle-time of different hydrological parameters (water level, conductivity, water temperature, pH, solid contents). In laboratory, using correlative and spectral analysis between input time series (meteorological parameters as air temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, precipitation amounts) and output time series (hydrological parameters), we will establish their characteristics in the time and frequency domains. The use of cross-correlogram for temperature and discharge, for example, will define the influence of air temperature to the glacier discharge, as well as its law of time distribution, that means the glacier response to weather changes and global warming. Chemical and isotopic analyses will be performed on water for completing the model of water circulation within the system (surface water, subglacial water and groundwater). \n\n2. At a global scale, the Spanish group started to develop the GLACE Project in 2001: GLAciers, Cryokarst and Environment (Proyecto GLACKMA, in Spanish). At the moment, 4 experimental pilot catchement have been implemented to assess the latitude effect on the hydrology of glaciers: 2 for temperate glaciers (Iceland at 64ºN and Patagonia at 51ºS) and two for polar glaciers (Svalbard at 79ºN and Insular Antarctica at 62ºS in subpolar glaciers). For all them, the discharge glacier is registering continuously. For the IPY, those stations will be maintained for generating time series in hourly frequencies like for the Loven East sensor-web. Additional new stations will be set up (at less one in the Antarctic Peninsula at S63º24 near ECARE, another in the Eastern Antarctica at 71ºS near Novolazarevskaya and another one around 70ºN latitude) for studying the variability of the global warming impact.",

On June 3, 1979, the well suffered a blowout and is recognised as the second largest oil spill in history.\n\nMexico's government-owned oil company Pemex (Petróleos Mexicanos) was drilling a 2-mile (3.2 km) deep oil well, when the drilling rig lost drilling mud circulation. In modern rotary drilling, mud is circulated down the drill pipe and back up the casing to the surface. The goal is to equalize the pressure through the shaft and to monitor the returning mud for gas. Without the circulating mud, the drill ran into high pressure gas which blew out the oil (known as a blowout). The oil caught fire and the platform collapsed.\n\nIn the next few months, experts were brought in to contain and cap the oil well. Approximately 10 thousand to 30 thousand barrels per day were discharged into the Gulf until it was finally capped on March 23, 1980. Prevailing currents carried the oil towards the Texas coastline. The US government had two months to prepare booms to protect major inlets. Mexico declined the US requests for cleanup compensation.\n\nThe oil slick surrounded Rancho Nuevo, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, which is one of the few nesting sites for Kemp's Ridley sea turtles. Thousands of baby sea turtles were airlifted to a clean portion of the Gulf of Mexico to help save this rare species.\n\nSummary provided by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixtoc_I",

            "definition": "The Arctic climate of the 20th century has undergone major fluctuations, which are characterized by a significant warming in the last two decades. The warming predicted for the high Arctic is 3–4 °C in winter during the next 50 years, more than twice the global average, while the ice cover is predicted to be reduced by ~80% during summer and ~20% during winter. This suggests that the Arctic may be where the most rapid and dramatic climate changes take place during the 21st century, with major ramifications for mid-latitude climate.\nThe sea ice cover has over the last 2-3 decades decreased by ~10%, and the ice thickness has decreased up to 40% during summer. Other observed changes include a warming of the Atlantic water in the Arctic Ocean, increased precipitation in the Arctic regions and higher river discharge into the Arctic ocean. During the last decades detected changes include a significant freshening of the deep North Atlantic Ocean, warming in the deep water of the Nordic Seas and a decrease of deep overflow in the Faeroe Bank Channel. The oceanic fluxes of heat and freshwater between the North Atlantic, Nordic Seas and Arctic Ocean are key components of the high-latitude climate system.\nThe recent Arctic Climate Impact Assessment studies have identified a number of severe impacts of Arctic warming on society. Changes in air temperature, precipitation, river discharge, sea ice, permafrost, glaciers and sea level have been documented and further changes are expected in the next decades. The Arctic region is coming under increasing pressure from unsustainable development with pollution and other negative effects on the environment. The exploitation of resources, including sea transportation and offshore operations will be heavily affected by the climate- variability and long-term changes at high latitudes. The northeast Atlantic, including Greenland and Icelandic waters, the Barents Sea and other Arctic ice edge regions, provides 20% of the world’s fish catch. Ocean temperature is one of the key variables that have influence on fisheries. Various offshore operations in ice-covered waters will increase such as offshore exploration, drilling, oil and gas production, and gas transportation, pipeline deployment in the seabed, and building of terminals in several locations along the Arctic coasts. All these activities will increase the risk of accidents and severe pollution of the fragile Arctic environment.\nThe Arctic areas have rough weather and ice conditions which require improvement of operational monitoring and forecasting services in order to safeguard all types of marine and coastal operations. The operational services should also include long-term data archiving services to build up statistics of the environmental conditions. Operational services on met-ice-ocean conditions in theses areas are extremely important for safe and cost-effective industrial and transport activities as well as for protection of the vulnerable environment.\nThe overall objective of IPY Arctic GOOS to develop and implement operational monitoring and forecasting systems in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. The systems will be based on state-of-the-art remote sensing, in situ observations, numerical modelling, data assimilation and dissemination techniques. The activities will include the development and maintenance of observing system for sea ice and physical, chemical and biological ocean parameters. The observing systems need to including icebergs, potential oil spills, radioactive spreading and other pollutants. In addition to observations, the systems will include numerical modelling and data assimilation for production of short-term forecasts. New models and data assimilation techniques need to be developed where needed. A long-term objective is to develop modelling systems for seasonal prediction of sea ice, hydrographic and current conditions. State-of-the-art climate models will be used to quantify climate change and variability and prediction of future climate changes under greenhouse gas scenarios.

The purpose of these CD-ROMs\nis to make available in a compact form through the Planetary Data\nSystem (PDS) a collection of relevant data to conduct analyses in\npreparation for the Earth Observing System (EOS), Mars Observer (MO),\nand other missions. The generation of this set of CD-ROMs was\nsponsored by the NASA Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program, the\nPlanetary Data System (PDS) and the Pilot Land Data System (PLDS).\n\nThis AAREADME.TXT file is one of the two nondirectory files located in\nthe top level directory of each CD-ROM volume in this collection. The\nother file, VOLDESC.SFD, contains an overview of the data sets on\nthese CD-ROMs and is written in a format that is designed for access\nby computers.

All other files on the CD-ROMs are located in directories\nbelow the top level directory.\n\nOn Volume 1, the directory DOCUMENT contains a text file named\nVOLINFO.TXT that describes the CD-ROM organization, the format and\ncontent of each of the data sets, and background information and\nreferences needed to understand the implementation of GRSFE and the\npreparation of the data sets on the CD-ROMs. It is recommended that\nyou read the VOLINFO.TXT document before using the data files. The\nDOCUMENT directory also includes text files that describe the format\nof some of the data files. These text files are referenced in the\ndetached labels that accompany the data files. The directory INDEX,\nalso on Volume 1, contains a number of index files. These files are\ntables in text form that have descriptive information about some of\nthe data sets on this CD-ROM. While the indexes can be visually\nscanned, they have been designed so that they can also be loaded into\nmost database systems for fast and efficient searching.\n\nSeparate directories exist for each instrument that acquired data for\nGRSFE. Each of these directories contains data set files and\nassociated detached labels. Some instrument directories are further\nsubdivided to manage a large number of files or to logically group a\ncollection of files.

Details on these can be found in the current GIANT work programme.\n\nThere has been considerable international cooperation in Antarctic Geodesy since SCAR was formed in 1958. The Geodetic Infrastructure for Antarctica (GIANT) program was identified in the SCAR 1992 meeting and has evolved as the coordinating program for all SCAR Antarctic geodesy.\n\nAntarctica is important in the context of global geodesy. In the past global models have heavily relied on observations from Northern Hemisphere sites and the results do not always fit in the Southern Hemisphere or represent the best global picture. Antarctic space geodetic observatories have provided data to rectify this imbalance.\n\nWith advent of man made satellites Geodesy has advanced significantly linking isolated geodetic networks and monitoring tectonic motion. A number of permanent GPS receivers have been installed in Antarctica and data is increasingly being retrieved by satellite transmission from these sites.\n\nThis fiducial network of GPS points, augmented by VLBI and other techniques, forms the basis for an integrated geodetic infrastructure as the basis for all scientific spatial data. Data from these sites in Antarctica are of ongoing importance to global geodesy, especially in the determinations of precise orbits and the integration of different observational techniques. These sites provide a stable platform for combining summer epoch campaigns, densifying the ITRF network across Antarctica.\n\nSummary provided by http://www.antsdi.scar.org/standardsspecifications/refsystemandprojections/refsystem/giant",

Alternatively, Giovanni would provide a means to ask relevant what-if questions and get back answers that would stimulate further investigations. This would all be done without having to download and preprocess large amounts of data. A secondary design goal was for Giovanni to be easily configurable, extensible, and portable. The GES DISC currently runs Giovanni on Linux, SGI, and Sun platforms.\n\nAnother goal of Giovanni was to off-load as much as possible the data processing workload onto the machines hosting the data and to reduce data transfers to a minimum. Given the enormous amount of HDF data at the GES DISC Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC), it was a requirement that Giovanni support HDF, HDF-EOS, as well as binary. \n\nSummary provided by http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/techlab/giovanni/",

The DIS will work closely with the Data Policy and Management Sub-Committee (Data Committee) and other data management bodies and observing networks to develop the IPY data and information policy and strategy. The DIS will then be the primary implementer of that strategy and policy recognizing that the strategy will need to evolve with the science needs and developments of IPY.\n\nAlthough much will depend on the strategy that is developed, we envision the DIS as an overall data management consultant and coordinator and a central data portal for an internationally distributed data management system. The DIS will continue to establish close partnerships with data centers and organizations around the world to build on existing systems. We will also work with each specific IPY cluster to ensure appropriate centralized data description and distributed archiving. Regional or discipline-specific affinity centers coordinated by the DIS will facilitate appropriate data description and archive. For example the Frozen Ground Data Center at the WDC, Boulder is working closely with the permafrost cluster, while the proposed Arctic Peoples Observations Center (EoI 358) could coordinate community-based monitoring data. Other potential affinity centers based on our current partners could include Russian data, Chinese data, data for education and outreach, remote sensing data, geospatial data infrastructures (regional and global), paleoenvironmental data, marine biological data, bibliographic data, and others (a detailed spreadsheet is available on request). Many of these affinity centers will likely create their own means of access to the data. It is unrealistic for a central DIS to be the single or even primary means of access, but we would like to establish a means to automatically share metadata across the system through a common (perhaps XML-based) framework\n\nSpecific activities of the DIS could include:\n-Collection (automated, where possible) of catalog metadata for all IPY projects and provision of Web-based portals to all IPY data archived around the world.\n-Examination and implementation of data discovery tools and data presentation schemes such as an interoperable web-based map server to enhance data access through a Web portal (could include a locator map for all IPY projects). \n-Identification of existing tools to facilitate data management, and build on those to meet the needs of the IPY community. For example, the Global Change Master Directory's (GCMD) metadata authoring tool, docBuilder, could be customized.\n-Serving as a focal point for cross-disciplinary data integration, especially across the natural and social sciences.\n-Creation of appropriate management tools for non-numerical data such as interview transcripts, photographs, and videotapes.\n-Collaboration with eGY to make data management best practices and principles available to researchers and agencies, via Web pages, workshops, and other channels.\n-Acting as a clearinghouse and facilitator for data management and integration issues that need research, discussion, and resolution.\n-Working with eGY to increase awareness of the value of data management for both numerical and non-numerical data.\n-Responsive service to the IPY research community regarding data management\n\nThe DIS will take advantage of existing data management infrastructures, organizations, and technologies such as National and World Data Centers, the Joint Committee for Antarctic Data Management (JCADM), the GCMD, virtual observatories, and the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure. This distributed system will allow for appropriate management of the various types of data including social science and physical science data, and analog collections. The distributed nature of the system will also encourage development of new and experimental data access methods, including data mining technology and innovative data presentation methods that facilitate data integration. \n\nIt is essential, however, to ensure ready and equitable access to and effective long-term preservation of the data. The DIS will assist distributed archives in adhering to sound data management principles and best practices as defined by the Data Committee, eGY, CODATA, WCRP CliC, JCADM, our partners, and other entities. We will ensure that these principles build upon existing international standards such the Open Archival Information System Reference Model and the ISO19115 metadata standard. The DIS will take advantage of emerging shared resources in the geosciences community, such as the effort to develop an international geophysical sample number (IGSN). In addition, the DIS could assist data providers in addressing human subjects protections and confidentiality issues for social science data and for other types of geo-referenced data.",

GALE was originally initiated in\nSeptember 1982 by a group of university scientists representing Drexel\nUniversity, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, North Carolina State\nUniversity, State University of New York and the University of Washington.\nThis project was mainly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF),\nOffice of Naval Research (ONR), National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n(NASA) and National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  Other\ncontributors included the Army Research Office and the Corps of Engineers, Air\nForce Office of Scientific Research, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and\nthe Department of Energy (DOE).  Local support was supplied by the\nRaleigh-Durham Airport Authority and Army Reserve National Guard and by the\nNorth Carolina State University Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric\nSciences.  The field phase of GALE was conducted from 15 January through 15\nMarch 1986.  The GALE Operations Center was located at Raleigh-Durham Airport\nwith the main observing network deployed throughout Virginia, the Carolinas,\nGeorgia and the Atlantic coastal waters.  The GALE project office is located at\nthe National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Boulder, Colorado.  The\nexperiment was designed to focus on three areas: the Inner, Regional and Outer\nGALE areas.  The Inner GALE area, 500 km wide, was centered on the coast and\nextended 1000km from Virginia to Georgia.  It examined for convection, boundary\nlayer fluxes and micro-physical processes.  The Regional GALE area, which was\n1000km wide from the Appalachian Ridge to 500km offshore and stretched 1500km\nfrom Florida to New Jersey, was studied for cyclogenesis and frontogenesis.  The\nOuter GALE area extended from the Great Plains to east of the Regional area and\nfrom New England to the Gulf of Mexico, with synoptic features of cyclones and\njet stream circulations being the main points of interest.\nData Sources:\n     The GALE observing region covered the eastern half of the United\nStates in order to incorporate continental and marine effects.  Data was\ncollected west of the Appalachians in order to evaluate the orographic\neffect on modifying large-scale systems or establishing mesoscale systems.\nData was also collected near the coast and offshore where cyclogenesis\noccurs; consequently this was the main area of interest.  Rawinsonde\nobservations were supplied by the National Weather Service (NWS) and NCAR\nalong with dropwindsondes from NOAA measuring standard meteorological\nparameters (temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed and direction).\nMeteorological satellites GOES-6, NOAA-9, NOAA-6, DMSP F-6, DMSP F-7\nand NIMBUS-7 were available to provide radiance measurements.  Surface\nobservations were taken from a special GALE ground-station network (PAM,\nPortable Automated Mesonet), NOAA buoys and platforms, micro-met towers,\nmilitary stations, lightning detectors, current meters and tide gauges to\nmeasure standard parameters along with rainfall, sea surface temperature (SST)\nand sea-level height.  Two research vessels, the Cape Hatteras and the\nEndeavor, patrolled the waters off the North and South Carolina coasts\nrespectively, collecting surface and atmospheric sounding data as well as SST\nand sub-surface data.  NOAA, NASA and NCAR aircraft gathered measurements of\nair motion, cloud physics, air chemistry and thermodynamics in the boundary\nlayer.

Exploring and Connecting the Poles\nProject URL: http://schc.sc.edu/gopolar/\nProposal URL: http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=96\n\nInformal learning environments of children's museums are fertile frontiers for communicating the excitement and significance of Polar scientific research to the public in both non-polar and traditional polar nations. Children's museums are also effective venues to enhance public understanding of the global dimensions of the issues facing the Polar Regions in the coming decades. By forming an international Go Polar! network of children's museums in non-polar nations (in Amsterdam, Osaka, Mexico City, Tel Aviv, Vienna, Melbourne, Caracas, Lisbon), as well as in traditional polar nations of Canada (Calgary and Toronto) and the United States (Indianapolis and San Francisco), we propose to deliver a multi-dimensional informal science education program about the Arctic and Antarctic to children under the age of 12 (and the adults who care for them). \n\nOur specific proposal, as part of the broad IPY outreach effort, is to: \n\n1) Adapt already existing Go Polar! Festival programming for use in museums of the Go Polar! network, complete with turnkey materials, including our patented Polar Puzzle, a unique floor interactive, educational displays and activities including specially developed teaching guides with sample scripts in the language appropriate to the particular museum; \n\n2) Adapt already existing Go Polar! Arctic Discovery Boxes for use in museums of the Go Polar! network, complete with turnkey materials, displays and including specially developed teaching guides with sample scripts in the appropriate languages; and \n\n3) Conduct training programs for teachers and museum staffs in the Go Polar! network in order that the Go Polar! informal science educational materials and programming can be used effectively during IPY and for years to come. \n\nThe existing Go Polar! informal science educational materials and programming are made possible through a University-Museum partnership funded by the US National Science Foundation in 2003 to develop Go Polar! Cool Science in the Arctic (ESI-0336928). This unique partnership between the EdVenture Children Museum, the largest children's museum in the southeastern US, and the University of South Carolina, the State's largest research university, involved active Arctic researchers, university undergraduate students, the EdVenture museum staff, family education specialists, and educational psychologists to disseminate on-going NSF funded research on the Arctic hydrologic cycle (ODP-0229737). \n\nThe Go Polar program provided opportunities for South Carolina children and families to meet real scientists engaged in Arctic research with hands-on activities that introduced children and families not only to the scientific process but also to new science concepts and knowledge. The Go Polar program also resulted in the development and testing of Arctic Discovery Boxes - specially designed informal education activities on three themes - #1 The Arctic and Global Change, #2 Arctic Cultures and #3 Animal Adaptations in the Arctic. Each Discovery box contains six interrelated hands-on activities with teaching guides and scripts. In 2005 the Go Polar! partnership expanded the reach of their programming and materials to include the Antarctic. Using the theme 'Exploring and Connecting the Opposite Ends of the Earth' the Go Polar! team created a Polar Festival featuring a giant floor puzzle of the Arctic and Antarctic with the ocean basins and surrounding continents connecting the poles. With orchestrated play, the children are guided through diverse hands-on, minds-on learning experiences including an Arctic Village, an Aurora Theatre, mapping the earth with NASA satellites, migration in the air and sea, ozone, permafrost, and more. Special take home activities and a Polar Passport encourage further exploration at home and school.",

The GSWP is charged with producing a 2-year global\ndata set of soil moisture, temperature, runoff, and surface fluxes by\nintegrating one-way uncoupled land surface process models (LSPs) using\nexternally specified surface forcings and standardized soil and\nvegetation distributions, namely, the ISLSCP Initiative I CD-ROM\ndata. Approximately one dozen participating LSP groups in five nations\nhave taken the common ISLSCP forcing data to execute their\nstate-of-the-art models over the 1987-1988 period to generate global\ndata sets.\n\nResults of the pilot phase suggest that the GSWP framework is very\nuseful and valuable for assessing and developing land surface models\non a global scale with relatively little computational expense, and to\ninvestigate questions of land surface hydrology and land-atmosphere\ninteraction.\n\n\n      Motivation:\n\nThe motivation for GSWP stems from the paradox that soil wetness is an\nimportant component of the global energy and water balance, but it is\nunknown over most of the globe. Soil wetness is the reservoir for the\nland surface hydrologic cycle, it is a boundary condition for\natmosphere, it controls the partitioning of land surface heat fluxes,\naffects the status of overlying vegetation, and modulates the thermal\nproperties of the soil. Knowledge of the state of soil moisture is\nessential for climate predictability on seasonal-annual time\nscales. However, soil moisture is difficult to measure in situ, remote\nsensing techniques are only partially effective, and few long-term\nclimatologies of any kind exist.\n\n      Goals:\n\nThe goals of GSWP are fourfold. The project will produce\nstate-of-the-art global data sets of soil moisture, surface fluxes,\nand related hydrologic quantities. It is a means of testing and\ndeveloping large-scale validation techniques over land. It serves as a\nlarge-scale validation and quality check of the ISLSCP Initiative I\ndata sets. GSWP is also a global comparison of a number of LSPs, and\nincludes a series of sensitivity studies of specific parameterizations\nwhich should aid future model development.\n\n      Production:\n\nThe GSWP consists of three components: the Production Group, the\nValidation Group, and the Inter-Comparison Center. The Production\nGroup consists of land surface modelers who conduct offline\nintegrations of land surface models over a global 1 degree grid for\n1987-1988 using prescribed atmospheric forcing based on observations,\nremote sensing and analyses. Each member of the production group\nproduces global time-mean and instantaneous fields of surface energy\nand water balance terms three times per month using his/her LSP. These\ndata are produced in a standard format and sent to the\nInter-Comparison Center. In addition, each model is used to perform\nspecific sensitivity studies. The sensitivity experiments are intended\nto evaluate the impact of uncertainties in model parameters and\nforcing fields on simulation of the surface water and energy balances.\n\nA number of different sensitivity studies were conducted by members of\nthe Production team. Perhaps the most significant general conclusion\nthat can be drawn from the studies is that sub-grid scale variability\nin infiltration, whether due to heterogeneity in soil properties or\nthe distribution of rainfall within a grid box, has a significant\nimpact on the simulation of runoff. Variations in vegetation\nproperties, the vertical structure of the soil, and radiation seem to\nhave less of an impact on simulations. These results suggest that some\nsort of accounting for sub-grid heterogeneity, whether through an\nexplicit modeling of small tiles or a statistical approach, is\nnecessary to properly partition surface water between runoff and\nevapotranspiration.\n\n\n      Validation:\n\nThere is also a Validation Group which assembles data sets and\ncoordinates studies to validate the global products, either directly\n(by comparison to field studies or soil moisture measuring networks)\nor indirectly (e.g. use of modeled runoff to drive river routing\nschemes for comparison to streamflow data). The soil wetness data\nproduced are being tested within a general circulation model (GCM) to\nevaluate their quality and their impact on seasonal to interannual\nclimate simulations. The Winand Staring Center has volunteered to lead\nthe validation process.\n\n\nThe validation effort allows some other important conclusions to be\ndrawn about the quality of the GSWP results. The use of the soil\nmoisture product as a specified boundary condition improves the\nforecast ability of a climate model. This is most likely as a result\nof mitigating the effects of poor rainfall simulations on the surface\nwater balance of the climate model. Secondly, comparison with\nobservations in more detail still point to significant problems in the\nway the LSPs deal with soil moisture, or more generally, land surface\nhydrology. Yet, it is clear that the quality of the land surface model\nsimulations are critically dependant on the quality of the land\nsurface data (soils, vegetation, terrain, radiative parameters) and\nthe meteorological forcing data.\n\n\n      Inter-Comparison:\n\nAn Inter-Comparison Center (ICC) has been established at the Center\nfor Climate System Research, University of Tokyo for evaluating and\ncomparing data from the different models. Comparison among the model\nresults is used to assess the uncertainty in estimates of surface\ncomponents of the moisture and energy balances at large scales, and as\na quality check on the model products themselves.  The ICC is also the\ncommunity re-distribution point for the data produced in GSWP.\n\n\nThe inter-comparison effort has shown that there is a large spread\namong the participating LSPs in terms of their partitioning of surface\nenergy between latent and sensible heat flux, and of water between\nrunoff and evapotranspiration. Most of the LSPs underestimated\nbasin-scale runoff, possible due to the GSWP specification of the\ntreatment of convective precipitation. Nonetheless, validation of the\nconsensus runoff against streamflow data show that the LSPs as a group\nperform quite well where sufficient gauge-based precipitation forcing\ndata were available, and performed poorly where gauges are sparse.\n\n      For more information, link to 'http://grads.iges.org/gswp/'",

            "definition": "An interdisciplinary research program using historical and environmental archives to analyze marine population data before and after human impacts on the ocean became significant.\n\nThe History of Marine Animal Populations (HMAP), the historical component of the Census of Marine Life (CoML), aims to improve our understanding of ecosystem dynamics, specifically with regard to long-term changes in stock abundance, the ecological impact of large-scale harvesting by man, and the role of marine resources in the historical development of human society. Since the earliest historical records, man has harvested a variety of different animals from the oceans. The effects of this activity on marine populations have been of increasing interest over the last century. While ecologists have traditionally aimed to identify the current conditions of many of the animal populations affected both directly and indirectly by harvesting, much less focus has been given to the status of affected populations in earlier times. A historical reference point of marine populations against which modern populations can be compared is necessary in order to determine how ocean ecosystems are changing with respect to human impact and even climate change. HMAP addresses this issue through multidisciplinary studies integrating Marine Ecology, History and Paleo-Ecology. This innnovative combination of research methods and analytical perspectives offers a unique approach to testing theories of the effects of both man’s activities and natural environmental changes on our living marine resources.\n\nMethods and Objectives\nTo achieve its goals, HMAP relies on the teamwork of ecologists, marine biologists, historians, anthropologists, archaeologists, paleo-ecologists and paleo-oceanographers. These integrated research teams analyze data from a variety of unique sources, such as colonial fisheries and monastic records, modern fisheries statistics, ship logs, tax documents, sediment cores and other environmental records, to piece together changes in specific populations throughout history. The resulting long time-series will improve our understanding of the effects of human activities and environmental factors, such as climate, currents and salinity, on marine ecosystems.\n\nHMAP implements its global mission through a case study approach. The case studies are generally regional in scope and focus on a few species of commercial importance or habitat and biodiversity changes. Individual studies are selected on the basis that the ecosystem has been subject to fishing and that there exists sufficient historical data on catches and harvesting effort. There are currently seven case studies around the world:\n\n    * Northwest Atlantic (Gulf of Maine, Newfoundland-Grand Banks, Greenland cod fisheries)\n    * Southwest Pacific (Southeast Australian Shelf and Slope fisheries, New Zealand Shelf fisheries)\n    * White and Barents Seas (Russian and Norwegian herring, salmon and cod fisheries, and Atlantic walrus hunting)\n    * Norwegian, North and Baltic Seas (Multinational cod, herring and plaice fisheries)\n    * Southwest African Shelf (Clupeid fisheries in a continental boundary current system)\n    * Worldwide Whaling (Historical whaling in all oceans)\n    * Caribbean communities (Impact of the removal of large predators)\n\nMany HMAP projects are interpreting changes in marine populations over the past 500-2000 years, which provides researchers of current and future conditions a baseline that extends back long before the advent of modern technology, or before significant human impact on the ecosystem.\n\nHMAP will result in a better understanding of the role of marine resources in human history and of the factors controlling marine populations. The project will help improve ecological theory, which can be applied to predict the effects of human activities on marine and aquatic ecosystems.\n\nSummary provided by http://www.hmapcoml.org/",

Line-by-line models are in good agreement with each other to within\n   a few W/m2 (usually within 1%) when arbitrary line width cutoffs\n   are universally applied. The ICRCCM concluded that: 'Uncertainties\n   in the physics of line wings and in the proper treatment of the\n   continuum make it impossible for line-by-line models to provide an\n   absolute reference . . .' (Luther et al. 1988). Thus, no\n   present-day model furnishes a reliable standard by which to judge\n   other models, nor are appropriate data available.\n\n2. There is no systematic difference between wide-band and narrow-band\n   model results. However, there is a large variation among the band\n   models. While average differences from line-by-line results range\n   from 5 to 10%, the spread among the band models is several times\n   larger.\n\n3. Band model calculations of sensitivities to changes in absorbing\n   constituents show poorer agreement with line-by-line results, and a\n   much larger spread, than calculations of flux components. For\n   example, when is doubled, the median band model sensitivities\n   differ by up to 18% from line-by-line values, while their spread is\n   an order of magnitude larger.\n\n4. In cases of only and only, the spread in results among band models\n   increases considerably compared to the case when all absorbing\n   gases are included; this indicates that the success in the latter\n   case is partly fortuitous because of the way absorbing bands\n   overlap in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n5. For the longwave clear cases, with about 40 participants\n   representing almost all the world's major modeling groups, ICRCCM\n   revealed intermodel disagreements in fluxes and flux sensitivity to\n   constituent changes ranging from 30 to 70% (Luther et\n   al. 1988). The disagreements are worst for single absorbing gas\n   atmospheres, indicating that the better agreement found in the\n   all-gas cases is partly accidental. Subsequent ICRCCM calculations,\n   involving cloudy longwave cases, and clear and cloudy shortwave\n   cases, have revealed equally large or larger disagreements, ranging\n   up to 20 to 30% in fluxes and up to 70% in flux sensitivity to\n   constituent changes.\n\n6. Comparisons are still in progress for vertical profiles of\n   radiative heating rates. Disagreements in radiative heating rates\n   are expected to be larger than for fluxes, because heating rate is\n   the derivative of flux and taking derivatives magnifies errors\n\n      For more information, link to\n'http://www.arm.gov/docs/documents/project/er_0441/bkground_5/radcompar_9.html'",

Rather, it is focussed on making use\nof research, of applying knowledge for the public good, and of\nmotivating basic and applied research in topical areas.\nGuided by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), the\nWorld Meteorological Organization (WMO), the International Council of\nScientific Unions (ICSU), and the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP), the planning for GOOS is taking place within five specific\nareas:\n        Climate Monitoring, Assessment, and Prediction\n        Monitoring and Assessment of Living Marine Resources\n        Monitoring of the Coastal Zone Environment and its Changes\n        Assessment and Prediction of the Health of the Ocean\n        Marine Meteorological and Operational Oceanographic Services\nU.S. GOOS activities are contained within many U.S. agencies, including\nNOAA, NSF, NASA, Navy (Office of Oceanographer and ONR), DOE, DOI,\nEPA, and State.

Economic studies have\nshown that the investment to obtain such observations and make such\npredictions is returned many times over in benefits to the\nagricultural sector in the U.S., plus additional benefits to other\nsectors.  At a lower priority within the climate module are the\nlong-term observations needed for the detection of climate change.\nThe second U.S. GOOS urgency is the development of an interagency\nCoastal GOOS Program, including those aspects of all the GOOS modules\nthat are relevant near the coast.  The coastal zone is under\nincreasing stress through population growth and land-use policies, yet\nis also the region of major sea-borne commerce and living marine\nresources.

To what extent were compromises made in the light of political barriers and logistical limitations? Another aspect is the role of new technologies, which is highlightened by the start of the first satellites and which has a significant input both in polar transport and research. Employing historical perspectives we will review essential background factors at work in the three distinct periods (both scientific and non-scientific), when nations chose to participate in the IPYs. In addition, we will consider the substantial factors that led certain major nations to choose not to contribute to the Polar Years (Great Britain 1882/83, Germany 1932/33, 1957/58, etc). Traditionally, field science practiced in remote geographical regions was either a by-product of exploration or an activity exploited by territorial claimants. The early attempts to establish an international polar organization will be seen as a backdrop to the later success in creating the Scientific Committee on Arctic Research (SCAR). Pertinent in this respect are the different roles played by non-governmental organizations as distinct from intergovernmental organizations or modes of international organization. Factors that enabled (or contrained or hindered) the institutionalisation of polar research more broadly under the auspices of the polar years will be studied also with an eye to drawing lessons for the future. The political role of the Antarctic treaty and the role of science in it is of course an important question in this context, as Antarctica at the political level became constructed as a continent by and for science (and peace). It is important to include the use of oral history, while some IGY veterans and constructors of the Antarctic treaty are still living.Such a study would not be complete without examining the impact of the Cold War on the IGY. Recent historical work has indicated that the IGY was simultaneously a crucial instance of international scientific co-operation at the height of political tensions between the Eastern and Western Blocs, but also an activity tightly integrated into the national security aims of major participant-states, including the United States and the Soviet Union. How Cold War tensions affected the practice of science during the IGY, and what lessons contemporary science planners and policy-makers can gain from a better understanding of the IGY's achievements and disappointments, are important anticipated outcomes from this project.",

McKee\n\nThis also pertains to Gulf Stream (GS), Long Range (LR)\n       and Ring (RI) Experiments\n\nDATA PROCESSING\n\nProcessing at the University of Rhode Island\n\n Initial data processing and float tracking were done at URI\nunder the supervision of H. T. Rossby. This consisted of subdividing the ALS\nrecords into individual float files. The signals for an individual float were\nextracted from the ALS data, and the floats were tracked in two steps. First,\nthe three ALSs which best surrounded a float geographically were used to track\nit hyperbolically, giving a series of positions and the time that the float\nemitted the tracking signal. These signaling times were used to obtain an\ninitial offset and drift rate for the float's clock. Then, the best pair of\nreceivers were used to track the float with circular (range-range) navigation\nusing the clock corrections and speed of sound corrections.\n\n The tracking procedure during GUSREX was identical to that used for\nprevious SOFAR float experiments and described by Spain, O'Gara, and Rossby\n(1980). The three daily times of arrival (TOA) of each SOFAR float's acoustic\nsignal were low-pass filtered and smoothed using a least squares polynomial fit\naveraged over 11 observations (3 2/3 days) which corresponds to a half power of\n1.5 days. Float positions were obtained from the smoothed TOAs using range-\nrange tracking. The final float trajectories were then smoothed with a filter\nsimilar to that used on the TOA's. A 'master position' tape containing indi-\nvidual float trajectories smoothed to 3 positions per day was prepared and sent\nto Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and this was used for our sub-\nsequent processing and data reduction.  For each position, a smoothed velocity\nand 48 hour average of temperature and pressure are included. Temperature and\npressure, telemetered from the float on alternate days (Spain et al., 1980)\nappear with the positions for those days. These data have been presented in two\ninformal reports prepared by the URI SOFAR Float Group (Line Experiment FLoats\n1980-1981, Line Experiment FLoats 1980-1982, Preliminary Data Report).\n\nProcessing at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n\n  In order to use the float data to make reasonable calculations of\neddy kinetic energy, variances, & vertical velocities, the data were careful-\nly reviewed for correctness. Tests on various methods of smoothing, subsamp-\nling, and filtering the data were performed to determine how the data set\nwould be processed. Analysis of the results indicated that the best basic data\nset would include one position for each day, since the smoothing already done\non the tracks had eliminated frequencies higher than a day (inertial and tidal).\nThe velocity components would be derived from the daily fixes using a cubic\nspline curve fit. This method produced velocities that are different from the\nURI velocities which are smoothed independently of the positions. The 48 hour\naverage temperature and pressure, transmitted by the float on alternate days\nwere selected rather than the smoothed temperature and pressure provided with\nthe URI format.\n\n  Basic processing was accomplished using a series of routines written\nby Roger Goldsmith and Terry McKee, known as the FLOATER programs. The initial\nprogram, REFORM, reads and reformats the data into VAX ASCII files, one for\neach float, in FLOATER format. In this form, the data is easy to access, man-\nipulate, edit and back up. The raw files were then passed through a sub-sampler,\nSSFDIF, that subsampled the first of the original 3 daily positions and recal-\nculated the east and north components of velocity based on a 24 hour interval.\nFirst differences between consecutive temperature and pressure values were\ncalculated. Listings of these derived values were produced along with prelim-\ninary trajectory and time series plots. These were reviewed to identify and\neliminate erroneous data. Unreasonably high speeds were used to identify bad\npositions. Radical changes in temperature that were not accompanied by a similar\nchange in pressure (or vice versa) usually indicated a bad value. Temperature\nand pressure values that drifted outside the range of the sensors were also\ndefined as bad. These points were removed by an editing program, FLEDIT, and\nflagged as gaps in the data. Gaps of less than ten days duration in position,\ntemperature and pressure were then linearly interpolated. Daily values of\ntemperature and pressure were interpolated from the bi-daily values recorded.\nFiles with gaps of greater than ten days in position information were broken\ninto sub files (GU109, GU154). These series were plotted and reviewed once\nagain for incongruities. Program FFSPLINE then fit a cubic spline to the float\npositions and recomputed the east and north components of velocity based on the\nbias and slope of consecutive positions.",

In order to increase spatial coverage of Holocene time series we will concentrate on marine sediments with relatively low but highest achievable resolution in the range of 50 to 200 years. Both, the data reconstruc- tion and the modelling efforts within this project, aim to investigate three-dimensional spatial-temporal patterns, i.e. two dimensions (the Earth&#039;s surface) and the time as third dimension. The advanced analysis of spatial and temporal variability in the data and in the model should enable the comprehension of climate changes detected in the data and the verification of climate variability observed in the model. Pattern analysis will provide a better understanding of the heterogenity in Holocene warming or cool- ing and the related mechanisms. The extension of the Holocene climate simulation into the next few centuries will enable a better assessment of future climatic change, due to similarities or dissimilarities between patterns of natural and anthropogenic disturbed climates. \n\nInformation provided by http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002EGSGA..27.2790K",

This\nventure involved over 140 countries and was the largest international\natmospheric experiment of its time.  The FGGE also encompassed the\nsummer and winter Asian Monsoon Experiments (MONEX) and the West\nAfrican Monsoon Experiment (WAMEX) designed to study monsoonal\ncirculations.  The FGGE was designed to observe and measure the\ndevelopment of global weather systems and to accumulate an enormous\ndata set for investigating the physics and dynamics of the global\natmospheric circulation and for understanding the mechanisms governing\nchanges in weather and climate.\nData Sources:\nThe FGGE observing system consisted of the World Weather Watch (WWW)\nsurface/upper-air network and voluntary observing ships, commercial\naircraft, polar orbiting and geostationary satellites, drifting\nmeteorological buoys mainly in the southern hemispheric oceans.\nDuring special observing periods (SOP) 5 January - 5 March 1979 and 1\nMay - June 30 1979, additional observing systems comprised of tropical\nwind observing ships, meteorological reconnaissance aircraft and\nstratospheric constant-level balloons were deployed.  The WWW\nobserving system consisted of 1030 upper-air stations, 2390 surface\nstations and surface synoptic reports from Mobile Ship Stations.\nFlight level data were supplied by 80 commercial aircraft equipped\nwith the Aircraft Integrated Data System (AIDS) providing temperature\nand wind measurements, along with 17 commercial aircraft equipped with\nthe Aircraft to Satellite Data Relay (ASDAR) system providing\nidentical data.  The three polar orbiting satellites, NOAA-5, TIROS-N\nand NOAA-6 contributed temperature and humidity profiles, sea surface\ntemperature (SST) data, high resolution pictures of clouds, surface\nwind speed over the oceans, total atmospheric water vapor and\nstratospheric soundings (NIMBUS-7).  TIROS-N and NOAA-6 also supported\nthe ARGOS data collection and platform location system associated with\nthe Southern Hemisphere Buoy System and the Tropical Constant Level\nBalloon System.  The five geostationary satellites, METEOSAT,\nGOES-Indian Ocean, GMS, GOES-WEST and GOES-EAST provided upper-air\nwind vectors from cloud motions, SST and communication support for\nASDAR.  The Southern Hemisphere Drifting Buoy System consisted of 301\nbuoys transmitting SST and pressure data to the TIROS-N/ARGOS system\nwith additional buoys distributed by aircraft as gaps developed.  The\nTropical Wind Observing Ships (TWOS) totaling 40 in SOP I and 43 in\nSOP II were equipped with upper-air sounding systems and wind-finding\nradar.  The Aircraft Dropwindsonde System (ACDWS) consisted of a fleet\nof long-range aircraft flying daily during the two SOP's along six\ntracks in the equatorial tropics, three in the Pacific, one in the\nAtlantic and two in the Indian Ocean.  Flight level data was obtained\nwhile 5091 sondes yielded temperature, pressure and humidity\nobservations from below the flight altitude (200-400mb) to the\nsurface.  The Tropical Constant Level Balloon System (TCLBS) utilized\n313 balloon launches at the 140mb level (above ACDWS) from Canton\nIsland and Guam in the Pacific, and Ascension Island in the Atlantic\nto provide wind observations.\nData Products:\nThe GARP/FGGE data are identified as Level-I, II and III corresponding\nto raw data (primary data), observations (meteorological parameters)\nand analyzed data (initial parameters).  The Level-II and III data are\nsubdivided into 'a' (data collected operationally in near-real time,\n'b' (data collected in both real and delayed time to obtain the most\ncomplete data set) and 'c' (data collected for climate research).\nTAPE PRODUCTS\n       1.

The IGS is committed to providing the highest quality data and products as the standard for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in support of Earth science research, multidisciplinary applications, and education. Currently the IGS includes two GNSS, GPS and the Russian GLONASS, and intends to incorporate future GNSS. The IGS collects, archives, and distributes GNSS observation data sets of sufficient accuracy to satisfy the objectives of a wide range of applications and experimentation. These data sets are used by the IGS to generate the data products (high accuracy GNSS satellite ephemerides, Earth rotation parameters, coordinates and velocities of the IGS tracking stations, GNSS satellite and tracking station clock information, timescale products, ionospheric and tropospheric information). In particular, the accuracies of IGS products are sufficient for the improvement and extension of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), the monitoring of solid Earth deformations, the monitoring of Earth rotation and variations in the liquid Earth (sea level, ice-sheets, etc.), for scientific satellite orbit determinations, ionosphere monitoring, and recovery of precipitable water vapor measurements. These activities endeavor to advance scientific understanding of the Earth system components and their interactions, as well as to facilitate other applications benefiting society. The Service also develops the necessary standards and specifications and encourages international adherence to its conventions. \n\nInformation provided by http://igs.org",

Being a resident of the arctic, I clearly understand the utter need for practical research that will help to strengthen and improve the health and well-being of community life, and will contribute to making our communities more resilient to the impacts of climate change.\n\nAt the 2006 World Urban Forum it was acknowledged by global decision-makers that climate change will be one of the key challenges faced by human settlements across the world. The goal of this research node is to build capacity for sustainable community development in Arctic regions so they are less vulnerable, more liveable and stand a better chance of coping with challenges posed by climate change. In the Arctic, building this capacity requires a proactive approach, collaboration amongst a wide range of partners, integration of policies across scales (national, regional, local), accommodation of cultural priorities, and practical application of research. \n\nThis is reflected in the 2005 Research Needs Survey for Nunavut published by C-CIARN North. It states:\nThe survey results suggest that Nunavut community members recognize considerable overlap among climate change impacts and that they do not generally view climate change adaptation challenges in isolation of other social and environmental pressures. Local climate change pressures need to reflect this holistic perspective, and focus largely on understanding the interactions and cumulative effects of climate change and a host of other factors such as resource development, rapid social change, population growth, health decline, educational achievement, long range contaminant transport, and other factors.\n\nClearly there is a growing need for the practical application of research on the uncertainty, challenges, and impacts of climate change on Arctic communities. However, in the Arctic there is a large gap between scientific research and building capacity for sustainable development.\n\nThis research will contribute practical results to climate change impact and adaptation research, provide examples of mitigation and contribute to the improving the health and well-being of Arctic communities. Areas of focus will be on housing design, building technology, alternative energy, community planning, waste management and capacity building. The current housing situation in many Arctic communities is one of severe overcrowding and complete reliance on diesel fuel for energy needs. This situation is leading to negative mental and physical health problems to individuals and leaving communities vulnerable to rising fuel prices. \n\nResearch under this activity cluster will take a much needed holistic approach to creating more environmentally friendly, affordable and culturally responsible housing options that positively contribute to the health and well-being of northern-based communities. Increased Arctic planning capacity will be needed in order to maintain community resiliency. This will require the integration of traditional knowledge and scientific research and involve Inuit, First Nation/Aboriginal groups, northerners, community planners, and scientists in different regions of the Arctic.\n\nCollaboration will involve Arctic and national governments, northern and southern-based organizations, and Arctic communities.",

In phase I the participants spent 47days sailing with hard work and rough seas, and the diet was rich in fat and poor in fresh foods. In this phase, glucose decreased and HDL-cholesterol, apo-AI, and TSH increased. Plasma retinol and α-tocopherol levels remained stable, γ-tocopherol, α-carotene and β-carotene significantly decreased, and lycopene significantly increased. Phase II lasted 49days including a 7-day long stop in port. This meant that a more varied diet was available and fresh foods were present in the hold. There was also less extreme physical activity. The metabolic pattern changed direction, glucose rose, HDL-cholesterol and apo-AI decreased and the levels of the vitamins that dropped in phase I started to increase. Lycopene significantly decreased.\n\nSummary Provided By:\n\nhttp://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0939475305001894",

Changes in the extent of glaciers will effect sea level, and may lead to substantial changes in sediment and fresh water supplies to embayments and fjords. \n\nIn ACIA, a simple approach was taken to estimate the runoff of all glaciers in the Arctic for a set of climate-change scenarios. Changes in the surface mass balance were calculated without dealing with the fact that glacier geometries will change. It was also assumed that the rate of iceberg production at calving fronts would not change. \n\nTo arrive at more accurate predictions, we propose an internationally-coordinated effort to study the dynamics of Arctic glaciers and develop new tools to deal with this dynamic response. The key elements of this effort are \n\n(i) to make better use of observational techniques to assess the detailed dynamics of a key set of glaciers, and \n(ii) to develop models that can be used to aggregrate data and that are sufficiently robust to have predictive power. \n\nA set of target glaciers have been identified for intensive observations (in situ and from space) for the period 2007-2010. This set covers a wide range of climatic/geographical settings and takes maximum advantage of prior long-term studies. \n\nThe target glaciers are:\n- Academy of Sciences Ice Cap (Severnaya Zemlya)\n- Glacier No. 1 (Hall Island, Franz Josef Land)\n- Austfonna (Svalbard)\n- Hansbreen (Svalbard)\n- Kronebreen (Svalbard)\n- Kongsvegen (Svalbard)\n- North Scandinavia transect (Langfjordjøkelen, Storglaciären, Marmaglaciären)\n- Vatnajökull (Iceland)\n- Kangerlussuaq basin (West Greenland)\n- Devon Ice Cap (Canada)\n- McCall Glacier (Alaska)\n- Hubbard Glacier (Alaska)\n- Columbia Glacier (Alaska)\n\nAmong the target glaciers are glaciers for which information is available on length/area in historical times [reports, drawings, photographs, old maps, etc.]. This information will be combined with the newly derived maps to reconstruct glacier evolution from the Little Ice Age into the present. This will provide a better perspective for projecting changes in the coming century.\n\nSpecial attention will be given to tidewater glaciers. We want to look carefully at the interaction between surface processes and dynamics (e.g. the influence of meltwater supply on ice velocities and consequently calving rates; interactions between terminal moraines, sediment flux, and ice velocities). In a warming world some glaciers will transform from cold to polythermal, or from polythermal to temperate. We want to study the effect of such transitions on glacier dynamics and related rates of retreat. Another important aspect of study is the surface albedo. Poor drainage of meltwater may lead to more extensive zones of soaked snow and supraglacial lakes (as seen in large parts of the Greenland Ice Sheet), thus enlarging the sensitivity of ablation rates to warming.\n\nModel development will be conducted in parallel with the observational programmes. The modelling work will deal with processes acting on the smaller scale (e.g. parameterization of the calving process) and on the larger scale (e.g. global dynamics of tidewater glaciers, response to climate change, interaction with sediment dynamics).",

Such a data set is required to increase our understanding of the interactions linking land-surface properties and the earth's climate.\n      \nThe idea of the ISLSC Project has two roots in the World Climate Programme. First, the use of time series of satellite data to monitor seasonal and long-term variations in land use and vegetation cover, in order to assess quantitatively the changes in the structure of the surface which occur either by man's action or as an impact of climate variability. Second the inference from satellite imagery of quantities needed either to improve upon the parameterization of land-surface/atmosphere interactions in climate models, or to generate input parameters for climate models.\n      \nThe ISLSC Project involves a series of sub-projects which concentrate on specific geographic locations. The first effort (Inter-Disciplinary Studies-Land Surface Climatology Project: IDS-LSCP) was designed to correlate historic satellite data with current satellite data and ground truth experiments in order to detect any long-term change in the land surface resulting from climate or human activities. The area of interest was in the southwest United States and in the Sonoran Desert of northern Mexico.\n\nThe second effort involved a field experiment (First ISLSCP FIELD EXPERIMENT: FIFE), which was designed to correlate existing satellite data and ground truth data in an effort to detect climate-related fluctuations or man-induced changes on the land surface. The FIFE site was located on the Konza Prairie in northeast Kansas. Another field experiment (Boral Ecosystem Atmosphere Study: BOREAS), using the same approach as in FIFE, is planned for two sites in the northern sections of the Canadian Provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba.\n\nData from the FIFE was originally archived with the NASA Pilot Land Data System (PLDS). In 1994, the FIFE data was transferred to the   Earth Observing System Data Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Data from the BOREAS will also be archived at ORNL DAAC as will other data from ISLSCP.",

The resulting change in water quality has many potential impacts on coastal and marine ecosystems. Phosphorus and nitrogen contribute to enhanced algae growth, and subsequent decomposition reduces oxygen availability to benthic sea creatures like fish, shell fish, and crustaceans. Changes to nutrient loadings can also change the phytoplankton species composition and diversity. In extreme cases, eutrophication can lead to hypoxia—oxygen-depleted “dead zones”—and harmful algal blooms.\n\nMeasuring chlorophyll concentrations as an indicator of algae biomass may provide one tool to assess coastal water quality and its change over time. Here, we used chlorophyll-a concentrations derived from NASA's Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) to analyze trends over a ten year period (1998–2007). We attempted to identify near-coastal areas with improving, declining, and stable chlorophyll concentrations that can provide guidance for decision making in the context of environmental management. \n\nhttp://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/es/seawifs.html",

It is well known that the SO connects the major ocean basins permitting a global scale thermohaline circulation, therefore Antarctic bottom water formation and its variability as well as its pathways towards lower latitudes is a relevant information. Interocean connection is a route for heat and freshwater (climate) anomalies, as well as anthropogenic tracers. The SO also plays a major role in the global climate change due to its key role in the global geochemical cycle, particularly carbon. The proposed activities during the IPY (2007-2008) are related to the actual work which is actually carried out in the SO (lat>30oS) by the Brazilian High Latitude Oceanography Group (GOAL), sponsored and funded by the Brazilian Antarctic Programme (PROANTAR). The main research topics of GOAL focuses in the understanding of (1) the formation and variability of dense bottom water close to the tip of Antarctic Peninsula; (2) the variability of Bransfield and Gerlache Straits ecosystems. (3) the role played by the SO in the global carbon cycle using in situ and satellite ocean color data; (4) the upper layer circulation and 3D structure eddies shedded by the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence. We also expect to undertake some transects, radiating outwards across the Antarctic tip continental shelf and slope, during austral summer period of January-March 2008, as a contribution to the project Synoptic Antarctic Shelf-Slope Interactions (SASSI), planned by the iAnZone group for the IPY 2007-2008. Furthermore, we hope to participate in an international focused effort to make observations along the three SO chokepoints where the meridional spread of the SO dynamics is constrained and where the transport measurements and interocean exchanges can be accurately monitored. These actions are part of the more general strategy presented by the CLIVAR/CliC/SCAR Southern Ocean Implementation Panel.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/details.php?id=911",

THORPEX intends to conduct research that will accelerate improvements in the prediction and understanding of high-impact weather on the 1 to 14-day time-scale for the benefit of society, the environment and the economy.\n\nThe aims of this cluster proposal are to improve numerical weather prediction model systems and climate models by utilizing remotely sensed and in situ observations taken during the IPY and to study and advance our knowledge of meteorological, surface and ocean phenomena typical for the region. The investigations will also improve our understanding and modelling of polar-global interactions. The scope ranges from high-resolution numerical weather prediction to climate and regional ocean modelling. The motivation comes from several applications: 1) Regional weather forecasting: In polar areas there are strong needs for accurate weather forecasts. Further model-based ocean, ice and wave forecasting need accurate forcing fields. 2) Medium range (global) weather forecasting: Improved model quality in polar areas influences forecasts at mid and high latitudes. 3) Climate studies.\n\nThe project has four objectives: \n\nThe first is on forecasting and to what degree an improved use of satellite data and an optimized observational network, including targeted observations, will improve forecasts of high impact weather events (IPY project numbers 294; 394; 638; 600; 798; 811; 113; 146; 206, 410, 92, 888, contribution related to meteorology). These studies will not be limited to forecasting conditions over the poles, but will also address polar-global interactions. These investigations will provide insight into the design of the global observing system and into the potential impact of any IPY legacy measurement sites. New satellite technologies will be used to develop products that can potentially improve weather forecasts.\n\nThe second objective is to better understand physical and dynamic processes in the polar regions, in general, with a specific emphasis on aerosols, the microphysical properties of clouds and the possibility of improving parameterisation schemes of clouds and radiation for use in numerical weather prediction and climate models (294; 638; 600; 798; 70; 116; 158; 206; 410; 113, 297). The spatial variations in surface characteristics, stable lapse rates and extreme seasonal variations in solar radiation make the polar environment unique and a challenge for parameterizations. \n\nThe third objective is a deeper understanding of the polar regions through a focus on small scale weather phenomena and the impacts of topography and surface variations (394; 638; 618; 811; 113; 134; 146; 167; 297; 888, contribution related to meteorology). Such research will also provide valuable insight on the limitations of coarse-grid models, since recent research has provided evidence for a wide variety of circulations (terrain-induced vortices, downslope winds, flow channelling, thermodynamic impacts of open water etc) that are often sub-grid-scale in climate and many forecast models. This work includes investigations of the flow distortion over Greenland and how it impacts the mesoscale thermohaline circulation. In some cases the higher resolution modelling capability will remain in place as a legacy of THORPEX-IPY activities.\n\nTaken together the research results from first three objectives the potential to improve future predictions of the weather and climate over the polar regions. Improvement in the initial state means an improved time series of operational and research analyses for climate change research.\n \nThe final objective is to utilize improved forecast systems to benefit society, economy and environment. High-impact weather events in polar regions include spring thaws, sea ice movement, and severe winter cyclones resulting in strong winds, high seas, and heavy precipitation as defined by their impact on public safety, fisheries and fishery management, activities of the indigenous arctic populations, wildlife, energy production and transportation. These problems are not local to the poles as the intrusion of polar air masses into higher latitudes also has dramatic impacts and many of the polar events are linked to wave trains that are initiated at lower latitudes. During IPY, the major operational forecast centers of the world will co-operate to form a THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) that will form the basis for research on ensemble prediction and on improving society's ability to utilize forecast information. TIGGE will also be made available for IPY field operations.",

            "definition": "Anthropogenic pollutants such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), other semivolatile organic pollutants (SOCs) and mercury can be transported over long distances from source regions to the remote Arctic. Since the Arctic does not exist alone and it shares a common atmosphere and aqua-sphere with the World, these pollutants can theoretically originate from anywhere globally and be carried to the Arctic by air and ocean currents. Studies conducted under the Northern Contaminants Program (NCP), the Canadian National Implementation Plan of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP), as well as others, have associated episodes of high POP concentrations measured on the western North American Arctic with atmospheric transport across the Pacific from potential sources in Asia. Such transport can occur in as short as 5 to 10 days. These pollutants have the tendency of depositing on terrestrial and aquatic surfaces in the Arctic and can bioaccumulate through the Arctic foodchain. Deposition of this kind has been assessed by the Western Airborne Contaminants Assessment Project (WACAP) in National Parks along the U.S. and Alaskan Pacific coasts. Due to their environmental persistence and potential toxicity, these pollutants can significantly affect the health of Arctic wildlife and human.\nThe current project aims at advancing our knowledge in the factors and mechanisms which influence intercontinental transport of pollutants and our understanding of the relative contribution of intercontinental versus intracontinental transport to the Arctic. These objectives can be achieved through coordinated source-receptor measurement of atmospheric pollutants coupled with multi-media transport modelling. It is proposed that simultaneous air sampling for mercury, POPs (e.g. chlordanes, DDTs, dieldrin, hexachlorocyclohexanes [HCHs], toxaphene, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]) and other anthropogenic chemicals (e.g. endosulfan, polybrominated flame retardants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs] and current-use pesticides) be conducted along both sides of the Pacific Ocean. These sampling sites include locations in northern China, Vietnam, Japan, eastern Russian Arctic and sub-Arctic, the western Canadian Arctic, Alaska and the west coast of the U.S.A.. Both conventional high volume air sampling (Hivol) and passive air sampling (PAS) methods (in cooperation with the Global Atmospheric Passive Sampling (GAPS) Project and Chinese POPs Air Monitoring Program) for POPs will be used to obtain air samples integrating over different time scales, ranging from 1-2 days (Hivol) to several months to a year (PAS). This allows the assessment of event-based transport episodes versus the overall impact averaged over seasons and years. This will also facilitate the development of PAS which are low cost and require little maintenance. For ambient air mercury measurements all sample analysis will be performed using the Automated Tekran Mercury Vapour Analyser as used in AMAP and NCP sampling sites. A coupled global-scale three-dimensional atmospheric transport and air / soil exchange model developed to investigate the transport of POPs (MEDIA) and the Global/Regional Atmospheric Heavy Metals Model (GRAHM) will be used to forecast trans-Pacific and intracontinental transport episodes of POPs and mercury to facilitate sampling, interpret air monitoring results and estimate the effect of climate change on the long-range transport of pollutants to the Arctic. This project will make use of existing air monitoring facilities for POPs established under AMAP, North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) China-Canada Joint Project on Reduction of Lindane Usage in China and its Impact Globally and on North America, as well as other national and university-based studies in Asia and North America. The new site of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy will be initiated in the Eastern Russian sub-Arctic to increase spatial coverage of measurements. Research will focus on:\n(1) fingerprinting chemical compositions of air masses from different parts of the Pacific;\n(2) identifying key chemical properties, e.g. vapour pressures and air-surface partition coefficients, and atmospheric dynamics, e.g. large-scale wind systems, pressure and geopotential heights, air temperatures, precipitation etc., which dictates chemical transport to the Arctic;\n(3) quantifying the relative contribution and major pathways of intercontinental versus intracontinental input of pollutants into the North American Arctic; and establishing background atmospheric circulation patterns for episodic trans-Pacific pollutant transport to the Arctic;\n(4) assessing and forecasting the potential influence of changes in atmospheric circulation patterns and climate variability on the long-range transport of pollutants to the Arctic.\n\nAll Arctic sites involved in this study will also be part of the IPY Core Activities of ATMOPOL ( #76) and COPOL (#175). Results from this project can be linked to the IPY EOI of TRANSARC Pollutants (#50) and other EOIs.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=327",

In particular, this warming was responsible for the collapse of Larsen A ice shelf in 1995 and Larsen B in 2002. Further south, Larsen C has thinned and continued warming could lead to its breakup within the next decade. \n\nTo date, access to the most active Peninsula regions has been limited, and little baseline glaciological data exist. As a result, large uncertainties remain in the determination of the mass balance of this region. Studies based on remote sensing and available in situ data show that a complex interaction is underway, involving enhanced precipitation at high elevation, enhanced melting at low elevation, sea ice retreat, enhanced surface and basal melting of land and shelf ice; glacier and ice shelf fracturing; melt percolation; seasonal changes in ice flow; and rapid glacial acceleration in the aftermath of ice shelf break-up. As the Larsen A and B ice shelves disintegrated they uncovered a glacial history preserved on the sea-floor indicating the current retreats are rare to unprecedented in the Holocene. \n\nThis proposal represents a combination of interests from GLABENAP, TRAPIS, APICS, and APY; these four activities sought to study ice- and climate-related changes at 3 different latitudes, and therefore 3 different stages of ice response to climate change. GLABENAP aims to investigate glacier response in the northernmost areas of the Peninsula, in the aftermath of the transition from continental Antarctic conditions to sub-polar Cordilleran styles of glaciation; APICS and TRAPIS aim to study the rapid changes where ice shelf retreat and glacier acceleration are underway at present; and APY has an interest in the precursors to this change, in basal melting and the influence of increasing summer surface melt on grounded glaciers further to the south around Larsen C. All 4 studies recognize the importance of climate, paleo-climate, geological and oceanographic influences; and all recognize the profound biological responses to change. This proposal is an umbrella organizational tool for several research projects focused on ice-climate interactions.\n\nWe propose an international program of logistical cooperation and scientific collaboration to measure, model, and understand the ongoing climate and glaciological changes in the AP. The results will document the evolution of shelf-glacier systems in a warming climate. Our field science program will install automated observing stations at selected sites, deploy an array of sensors designed to monitor glaciological and geophysical parameters of importance that cannot be collected any other way, and collect critical climate and paleoclimate data. During these campaigns, we will gather baseline data on ice motion, thickness, structure, and internal temperature. The program will also further investigate the sea-floor sedimentary record, promote ongoing west coast ecosystem research, and initiate a program of biological and oceanographic observation along the eastern coast. Remote-sensing-based studies will continue, using both new and existing tools, both airborne and satellite based. We envision a coordinated logistical plan combining US, UK, Chilean, Brazilian and Argentine airborne and ground assets, and we plan US and UK research vessel cruises that would support both land and sea field work. It is our hope that the logistical paths established as part of IPY will lead to continuing and growing cooperation in the Peninsula in the following years.\n\nWe will establish an IPY-AP web forum, and organize regular workshop meetings building on recent successful meetings at Hamilton College and SPRI that will provide a venue for discussing results, promoting outreach, and planning research activities.\n\nThe Antarctic Peninsula is a model for a future, warmer Antarctica. What we see there are changes of greater scale, speed, and magnitude than were considered possible before. IPY-AP seeks to better observe this system and its responses to know what the future may hold. This region of the World is ideal for international collaboration from geopolitical, logistical and scientific standpoints in the context of IPY.",

The activity brings together two complementary programmes: the International Heliophysical Year (IHY) (EoI 172) is an international programme to coordinate the use of current and forthcoming spacecraft missions with ground-based observatory instruments to study the Sun's influence on the heliosphere, including effects at the Earth; ICESTAR (EoI 554), endorsed by SCAR, aims to coordinate research on magnetospheric and ionospheric responses to solar inputs, with emphases on the networking of ground-based instrument networks and the study of inter-hemispheric relationships. \n\nThe proposed joint project includes the collective effort of 24 international consortia which submitted their Expressions of Intent (EoIs) to the IPY call in January 2005. Between them, these groups already run a large body of instrumentation in both the Arctic and the Antarctic to support this research programme. Several consortia are also proposing to install new instruments in the polar regions to significantly improve the spatial coverage and resolution and to provide pairs of geomagnetically conjugate observations from both the hemispheres. The resulting observations and value-added data products will be used together with state-of-the-art models and simulations to improve our quantitative understanding of the near-Earth space environment. \n\nThe scientific goals of the 24 EoIs can be categorised under the following three main themes: \n\n(i) Coupling processes between the different atmospheric layers and their connection with the solar activity: E.g. effects of mid-atmospheric circulation and extreme solar activity on the content of stratospheric ozone and minor constituents, variations of the cosmic ray fluxes above the polar areas and South Atlantic Anomaly, energy transfer from powerful weather fronts to geospace heights and using novel technology for stratospheric magnetic field measurements.\n\n(ii) Energy and mass exchange between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere: E.g. multiscale and tomographic studies of ionospheric phenomena (auroral precipitation, convection, turbulence and electron content) as driven by magnetospheric and solar activity, remote-sensing of the radiation belts, and balloon-borne radio soundings of the ionosphere in conjunction with ground stations and satellites as pilot studies for future NASA missions.\n\n(iii) Inter-hemispheric similarities and asymmetries in geospace phenomena: Science goals as above but under this theme special emphasis will be put on using both Arctic and Antarctic observations. In addition to several magnetometer and optical instrument networks bipolar data will be available also from HF-radars, riometers, digital ionosondes, dynasondes, dual-frequency GPS receivers and LEO satellite beacon receivers.\n\nEach project in the combined proposal has a set of project-specific scientific objectives, but the interrelationships between the studied processes mean there is significant synergy between the projects. The result is that the overall proposal will be able to address topics with far-reaching scientific impact and of importance to society at large. For example, a practical benefit will be improved prediction of space weather phenomena which adversely affect spacecraft operations, humans in space, and satellite-based positioning systems; on the scientific side, global scale coordination of observing networks will allow us to study conjugate and multi-scale geospace phenomena in fundamentally new ways.\n\nIHY will coordinate an overarching synoptic observation programme and will provide systems and assessment processes for coordinating and facilitating dedicated campaigns in order to reap the advantages of interdisciplinary observations. To facilitate data sharing, ICESTAR will lead an effort to establish a set of Virtual Observatories in accordance with concept of the Electronic Geophysical Year (eGY). Frequently updated web-pages will be the most effective way to disseminate the scientific results. Special sessions at international meetings and dedicated workshops will provide other channels to reach the broader community and to efficiently collect feedback. The public awareness of ICESTAR/IHY activities will be increased with popular articles and web-pages and with regularly coordinated media events.",

Stratospheric air\nfilter samples and gas samples were collected at several\nlocations in North and South America and analyzed for nuclear\ndebris/trace gases.\n\nThe database includes several sets of information about archived\nsamples and data. The High-Altitude Balloon Sampling Program,\nProject Ashcan, ran from 1956 to 1983. This program used large\npolyethylene balloons to collect samples at altitudes from 20-27\nkm. The Stardust program used WU-2, RB-57F, RB-57C, and C-130\naircraft to collect samples at altitudes of 6-19 km, and ran\nfrom 1961 through 1967. However, there were earlier aircraft\nsamples also collected (1957-1961), which were simply called the\nHigh-Altitude Sampling Program at the time, and which are\ntreated here as belonging to Project Stardust due to\nsimilarities in collection and analysis procedures. In 1967, the\naircraft sampling continued under the Airstream program, which\nwas discontinued in 1983.\n\nFor more information, link to 'http://www.eml.doe.gov/databases/hasp/'",

GHCN is\nproduced jointly by the National Climatic Data Center, Arizona State\nUniversity, and Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center at Oak Ridge\nNational Laboratory. GHCN version 1 was released in August of 1992 and has data\nfrom ~6,000 Temperature stations ~7,500 Precipitation stations ~2,000 Pressure\nstations The earliest station data is from 1697. The most recent from 1990. It\nwas created from 15 source data sets. Quality Control included visual\ninspection of graphs of all station time series, tests for precipitation\ndigitized 6 months out of phase, tests for different stations having identical\ndata, and other tests.\n\nGHCN version 2 is currently being created. A beta release of precipitation\ndatawas made in April 1998 (the most recent data of which is from 1996) and the\nfull version 2 temperature data was released in 1997. Version 2 has significant\nimprovements over version\n\n1: more data (e.g., the precipitation data set has data from over 20,000\nstations) from more sources (over 30 different sources including the Colonial\nEra Archive Project contributed to version 2), more elements (mean monthly\nmaximum and minimum temperature data as well as mean temperature), better\nQuality Control, homogeneity adjustments, and a wider selection of metadata.\nVersion 2 will also be regularly updated and irregularly have data from\nadditional stations added to the data set. Therefore, with the release of GHCN\nversion 2 temperature data, we have removed GHCN version 1 temperature data\nfrom our anonymous ftp site. There are many unique features in GHCN version\n\n2. For example, we have determined many cases where different sources have\nprovided us with different mean temperature time series for the same station.\nBecause meteorologists calculate daily mean temperature many different ways,\nthere can be many different 'correct' mean temperatures. Therefore, for many\nstations, GHCN provides more than one mean temperature time series. Also, GHCN\nversion 2 has some unique and potentially very useful station metadata such as\npopulation and vegetation indicators. To understand GHCN version 2 temperature\ndata and metadata, please read our overview of it.

In January 1991 a\nseries of coded sound waves was transmitted from an underwater station\nnear Heard Island in the southern Indian Ocean. The waves were later\ndetected across a network of 16 sites (some on board vessels at sea)\npositioned along great-circle sightlines (or perhaps soundlines would\nbe a more appropriate term) around the world. One example: the signal\ntook 2.95 hours to reach the Bermuda station 16,000 km away. The\nresearchers were generally satisfied with the quality of the received\nsignals, as measured by the signal-to-noise ratio and the stability of\nthe waveform over time. They suggested, however, that for monitoring\nocean climate variability acoustic thermometry should be integrated\nwith satellite me!  asurements. On another point of concern, the\nscientists found no evidence that the sound transmissions produced any\ndistress among local marine mammals.

To the international arctic social sciences community, ICASS VI will act as its major forum to review its contribution to the overall IPY effort; to discuss the status of the ongoing social programs under IPY 2007-2008; and to make plans for further actions.\n \nThe working title for ICASS VI is 'Circumpolar Social Changes: Opportunities and Challenges for Social Sciences in the International Polar Year 2007-2008.' Based upon the attendance at previous ICASS ventures (a triennial event), ICASS VI will bring together many hundred social scientists from every field of social and human research, advanced students from over 20 countries, as well as indigenous and non-indigenous stakeholders. We expect the attendance to be boosted by the presence of our project partners from physical and natural science disciplines, to make ICASS VI a fully interdisciplinary venture - much like the IPY 2007-2008 itself. \n\nThe main goal of ICASS VI is to offer various venues for IPY scholars, other northern researchers, and local participants to analyze the progress of IPY 2007-2008 in social and human fields. This includes special project sessions, discussion panels, plenary presentations, invited talks by the leading IPY scientists and representatives of the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, public meetings. Sessions and panels at the ICASS VI will be framed along major IPY research fields and initiatives, with the broad international and interdisciplinary participation. For many international network projects, ICASS sessions will offer the only chance for face-to-face discussions, as participants from many countries and regions may have limited contacts in the field and across the boundaries. Special efforts will be made to ensure presence of as many project collaborators from arctic communities, as possible. \n\nHaving ICASS VI held in Nuuk, the capital of the only indigenous self-governing Arctic country, will give an unprecedented voice to polar residents and indigenous peoples. Timing and location for this major scholarly meeting to review the progress of IPY 2007-2008 cannot be better selected. ICASS sessions will be open to representatives of northern governmental agencies, indigenous institutions, media people, and interested public to ensure broader input from northern practitioners and local communities. We envision ICASS VI also as a critical milestone to the IPY 2007-2008 outreach, public, and educational agendas, because of so many young Greenlandic students and educational institutions in town. The presence of social scientists from many countries, presentations on many projects across the circumpolar world will inspire the young generation of Greenlandic educators and leaders, and will give tremendous local publicity to polar research.",

One need\nwas to determine the distribution and abundance of whales and dolphins\nin the eastern Gulf, an area of potential future oil and gas\nexploration and production.  GulfCet II also continued surveys in the\nwestern and central Gulf to monitor the abundance and distribution of\ncetaceans.  Another component of GulfCet II was to conduct focal\nstudies specifically designed to address whale and dolphin\nassociations with habitats (physical environment and available prey).\nThese studies used satellite altimeter data to plan transect lines to\nsurvey through cyclonic and anticyclonic gyres and determine cetacean\nand seabird abundance within various hydrographic features.  GulfCet\nII was the only marine mammal study that used an ecosystem approach,\nintegrating visual and acoustic surveys with satellite imaging,\nhydrographic collections, and trawl samples.\n\nThe GulfCet II Study has shown us that sperm whales, and other\ncetaceans, are found in conjunction with area of upwelling and\nnutrient enrichment that enhance productivity and prey abundance.\nCetaceans in the northern Gulf of Mexico concentrate along the\ncontinental slope in or near cyclones (upwelled waters) and the\nconfluence of cyclone-anticyclone eddy pairs.  Cyclones also had the\ngreatest diversity of seabird species, although habitat use varied\namong species.  High numbers of zooplankton, lanternfish, and squid\nwere found inside cyclone and confluence areas.  While whales and\ndolphins do not occur randomly in the gulf, it is important to\nremember the dynamic nature of the hydrographic features with which\nthey associate.  As the features move and change, prey distribution\nchanges and moves, and so will the presence and movements of whales\nand dolphins.\n\nFor more information, link to\n'http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/regulate/environ/marmam/gulfcet2.html'",

            "definition": "The U.S. Historical Climatology Network (U.S. HCN) was compiled\n in response to the need for an accurate, unbiased, modern\n historical climate record for climate change research. The\n Carbon Dioxide Research Program of the U. S. Department of\n Energy and the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) of the\n National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n established a network of 1219 stations in the contiguous United\n States for the specific purpose of compiling a data set\n suitable for detecting and monitoring climate change over the\n past two centuries. This network, known as the U.S. Historical\n Climatology Network (U.S. HCN), and the resulting data set were\n initially documented by Quinlan et al. (1987) and made\n available free of charge through the Carbon Dioxide Information\n Analysis Center (CDIAC). The data presented in Quinlan et\n al. (1987) extended only through 1984. In 1990 NCDC and CDIAC\n revised and updated the HCN data records through 1987 (Karl et\n al. 1990). In addition, !  using the techniques of Karl et\n al. (1988), NCDC generated temperature files in which the\n biases introduced by urbanization effects were removed.  The\n new revision 3 (Easterling et al. 1996) data represent the best\n available data from the United States for analyzing long-term\n climate trends on a regional scale and may be used for studies\n attempting to determine the climatic impacts of increased\n concentrations of greenhouse gases. The data for most stations\n extend through December, 1994, and a majority of the station\n records are complete for at least 80 years. Unlike many data\n sets that have been used in past climate studies, these data\n have been adjusted to remove biases introduced by station\n moves, instrument changes, time-of-observation differences, and\n urbanization effects.\n\nSource and Scope of the Data:\n\n\nOne of the objectives in establishing the U.S. HCN was to detect\nsecular changes of regional rather than local\nclimate. Therefore, only those stations that were not believed\nto be influenced to any substantial degree by artificial changes\nof local environments were included in the network. Some of the\nstations in the U.S. HCN are first order weather stations, but\nthe majority were selected from U.S. cooperative weather\nstations (approximately 5000 in the United States). To be\nincluded in the U.S. HCN, a station had to be active (in 1987),\nhave at least 80 years of mean monthly temperature and total\nmonthly precipitation data, and have experienced few station\nchanges. An additional criterion that was used in selecting the\n1221 U.S. HCN stations, which sometimes compromised the\npreceding criteria, was the desire to have a uniform\ndistribution of stations across the United States.  The 1221\nstation U.S. HCN database contains station histories, monthly\ntemperature (maximum, minimum, and mean) data, and total monthly\nprecipitation data that were compiled by NCDC after being\nextracted from digital and nondigital data sets archived at\nNCDC. These data sets originated from a variety of sources,\nincluding climatological publications, universities, federal\nagencies, individuals, and data archives. All stations were\nquality controlled by NCDC with the use of outlier and areal\nedits, and each station in the network was corrected for\ntime-of-observation differences, instrument changes, instrument\nmoves, station relocations, and urbanization effects (Karl et\nal. 1986; Karl and Williams 1987; and Karl et al. 1988). A\nunique feature of the data set is that, within most temperature\nand precipitation data files, both original and adjusted\nestimates are given, along with confidence factors for each\nadjusted estimate. Another unique feature of the database is\nthat in r!  elation to the long periods of record, a small\nportion of the data are represented as missing. In order to make\nthe U.S. HCN record as serially complete as possible, missing\ndata have been estimated by using data from neighboring\nstations. The majority of the 1221 stations have had data\nrecords that are serially complete since 1900; where serially\ncomplete is defined as having original or adjusted data\navailable for all months after the reported serially complete\ndate for a given station.\n\nApplications of the Data:\n\nThe U.S. HCN database represents the best monthly temperature\nand precipitation data set available for the contiguous United\nStates. It provides an accurate, serially complete, modern\nhistorical climate record that is suitable for detecting and\nmonitoring longterm climatic changes on a regional scale and may\nbe used for studies attempting to determine the climatic impacts\nof increased concentrations of greenhouse gases. The U.S. HCN\nclimate record may also be used by dendrochronologists and\npaleoclimatologists for calibrating tree ring growth, pollen,\nand marine plankton data or by those studying the climatic\nimpacts of periodic events such as El Nino/Southern Oscillation\nor volcanic eruptions. Those studying longterm climatic changes\non smaller scales, may want to review the information given in\nthe appendices in order to identify the stations most suitable\nfor their research needs.\n\nFor more information, link to\n'http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp019/ndp019.html'",

The resources required are\ndistributed among several federal agencies, scores of universities, and a\nvariety of scientific disciplines-- including atmospheric science, biology,\nland processes, and oceanography.  NASA's contribution to the GTCP is the\nGlobal Tropospheric Experiment (GTE), which utilizes large, extensively\ninstrumented aircraft, along with satellite observations of meteorology, land\nuse, and atmospheric chemical species to aid in experiment design and in the\nscientific analysis of results obtained from aircraft and ground-based\nmeasurements.\nThe first series of projects carried out under the GTE was the Chemical\nInstrumentation Test and Evaluation (CITE) projects which exposed instruments\naboard aircraft to a wide range of conditions in both polluted and and\nclean-air settings.  CITE-1 was conducted in 1983 and consisted of a\nground-based experiment at Wallops Island, Virginia and aircraft-based over\nCalifornia, southwestern U.S. and the central Pacific Ocean.  CITE-2 was\nconducted in 1986 over California and the eastern Pacific, and CITE-3 was\nconducted in 1989 over Wallops Island, Virginia and the tropical Atlantic off\nthe coast of Brazil. The advanced instruments validated by CITE have been used\nto carry out GTE field measurements.\nThe initial field expeditions, the Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiment (ABLE)\nprojects, were designed to probe the interactions between the biosphere and the\natmosphere.  They measured the fluxes of gases between the surface and the\natmospheric boundary layer (the tropospheric layer in direct contact with the\nsurface) and the mixing of gases from the boundary layer into the 'free\ntroposphere' above. The ABLE-1 experiment was conducted in 1984 over the\ntropical Atlantic from a base in Barbados; ABLE-2 was conducted in 1985 and\n1987 over the Amazon region; ABLE-3 was conducted in 1988 and 1990 over Alaska\nand northern Canada.\nFuture experiments scheduled for the early 1990's include: the Transport and\nChemistry in the Atlantic (TRACE-A) which will investigate the distribution of\natmospheric trace gases over the tropical Atlantic; also the Pacific\nExploratory Mission (PEM) which will study atmospheric chemistry over the\nPacific Basin.\nData Used and Produced:\nGTE is primarily a aircraft-based program supplemented by ground-based\nmeasurements.  The aircraft include the NASA Convair-990 and the Electra.\nSpace Shuttle, Landsat, and the NOAA weather satellites are also being\nutilized.  Global observations from space will ultimately be the technique of\nchoice for mapping the distributions of reactive, spatially variable chemical\nspecies.  Aircraft measurements will eventually provide 'ground truth' for\nsatellite measurements and explore in detail the processes responsible for the\nobserved distributions.\nThe Public Archive of data collected on the NASA/GTE program consists of data\nfrom the CITE-1 Wallops Intercomparison Test in 1983 through the Amazon\nBoundary Layer Experiment (ABLE-2B) in 1987.  These data are stored on various\nmedia including IBM-PC compatible diskettes, VAX 9-track tapes, tabular paper\nlistings, plots, videos and other film products, as well as weather charts and\nsummaries.\n1. CITE-1 data: species measurements of methane, ozone, aerosols, carbon\nmonoxide, nitric oxide, hydroxyl radical, hydrocarbons, non-methane\nhydrocarbons, sea salt, and ultraviolet flux, along with wind, temperature, and\ndew point.\n2. CITE-2 data: species measurements of carbon monoxide, ozone, nitric oxide,\nnitrogen dioxide, reactive nitrogen, nitric acid, and peroxyacetyl nitrate.\n3.

            "definition": "The main aim of the study is to reach a better understanding of the evolutionary history and genetic diversity of Gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua). The main colonies of gentoo are on the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and Kerguelen Islands; smaller populations are found on Macquarie Island, Heard Islands, South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. The key problems to be solved are the problems of the analysis of genetic variability and genetic structure of populations, the level of genetic diversity, the problems of adaptation to Antarctic environment and ecological impact on genetic structure of populations. We are planning to investigate populations of gentoo from the most southern to the most northern with several intermediate groups. Birds will be weighted, measured and blood samples will be collected. The analysis of progeny number per nest will be carried out also; this parameter for tourist-visited and non-visited populations will give some figures on tourism impact on gentoo reproduction. The main objectives of this project are: 1. To evaluate the level of phenotypic and genotypic variability. 2. To study the genetic structure of penguins' populations. 3. To estimate genetic and phenetic differences between populations and between the two subspecies (P. p. ellsworthii and P. p. papua). In addition, we also intended to: 1. Measure possible genotype-phenotype correlation. 2. Investigate the genotype-dependent level of environmental impact on instability of genome and instability of individual development. 3. Evaluate the impact of tourism on breeding success by comparing visited and non-visited populations. The average levels of heterozygosity, polymorphism and the number of alleles per locus will be calculated as parameters of genetic variability. The data on frequencies of alleles and genotypes will be obtained for each studied population. It will help to ascertain the genetic structure of populations and calculate genetic distances among populations. The following populations may be studied: Islands: Petermann, Wiencke, Livingston, Signy, Falklands, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands. We intend to collect data from tourist-visited and non-visited nestings. Existing data suggest the little or non significant effect of disturbing gentoo populations by tourist groups on breeding performance. Nevertheless, the human impact on population may cause changing its gene pool. \n\nhttp://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/details.php?id=379",

No other technology developed since the IGY of 1957 provides the high-resolution, continental-scale, frequent-repeat, and all-weather observations available from spaceborne sensors. The utility of that technology is evidenced by associated scientific advances including measurements of long term trends in polar sea ice cover and extent, the realization that the polar ice sheets can change dramatically at decade or less time scales, and the quantification of relationships between processes at the poles and at mid and equatorial latitudes. There are many examples of successful spaceborne observations from pole to pole for scientific, commercial and governmental purposes. These successes encourage the use of the capabilities and consequently, the competition for access to resources from the international constellation of satellites becomes increasingly more intense. Frequently, this means that there are only limited opportunities for conducting large-scale projects that consume a significant fraction of system capabilities for some dedicated period of time. One example of a large-scale coordinated effort is the Radarsat Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) that required months of dedicated satellite and ground support time to achieve its objective of obtaining near instantaneous snapshots of Antarctica to serve as gauges for measuring future changes. \n\nLarge-scale coordinated-experiments will continue to be important for polar scientists seeking to understand the role of polar processes in climate change, the contribution of the polar ice sheet to sea level, ice sheet and ocean interactions, and the dynamics of ice sheets and sea ice. These future missions will be further enhanced if complementary observations and data analysis from different satellite sensors can be coordinated (for example: MODIS, MISR, IceSAT; RADARSAT1 and RADARSAT2 (currently operating, and to be launched in 2006, respectively); ALOS (launched in January 2006); TerraSAR-X (launch 2006); the new approved ESA Earth Explorer series: GOCE (launch tbc 2007) - SMOS (launch tbc 2007) - ADM/Aeolus (launch tbc 2008) together with: - Envisat (currently operating) - METOP (launch tbc 2006)). Complementary to these hemispheric-scale projects are short-term, focused data acquisition campaigns over several weeks in support of coordinated and intensive ground-based and suborbital instrument measurements of the polar cryosphere, as recently proposed to NASA by the Polar Gateways subgroup for an Antarctic high-altitude balloon flight of an ice sounding radar. But across the temporal and areal scale of observations, coordination is challenging in part because of resource allocation issues and in part because space programs are operated by a host of national and international agencies. To overcome those challenges, the international polar science community needs a common rallying point. \n\nWe propose to develop an international science plan for coordinated spaceborne and in situ observation of the polar regions and polar processes as part of the proposed International Polar Year and as part of the IGOS-Cryosphere theme implementation. The goal is to advance polar science by obtaining another critical benchmark of processes in the Arctic and Antarctic during the IPY and to set the stage for acquiring future benchmarks beyond IPY. The technical objective is to coordinate polar observations with spaceborne and in situ instruments and then make the resulting data and derived products available to the international science community. Acquisitions must be tailored to concentrate on those science problems that would best be served by a focused, time limited data acquisition campaign and/or those problems that would be served by having a diverse but integrated set of observations. One possible expansion of this idea would be to include ice covered regions from pole to pole that are known to be important contributors to current sea level change. Another extension could focus on the polar ionosphere which impacts active radar sounding and communications for orbital satellites. A new interdisciplinary objective could be to integrate cryospheric and ionospheric measurements to maximize resolution of cryospheric structures and changes over time. Accomplishment of this objective requires coordination between cryospheric and ionospheric data archives, e.g. respectively the NASA-supported data facilities for the Earth Observing System and for Sun Solar System Connection (S3C). Our lead institutions are involved in EOS while the lead of the Polar Gateways group is Chief Scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center for S3C.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to develop the most effective mechanism by which to plan and synchronise IPY satellite acquisition data requests (ultimately resulting from approved IPY Projects) via an instrument such as a coordinated IPY ESA Announcement of Opportunity (AO), a NASA Research Announcement, and national consultation activities conducted by collaborating agencies. This is necessary in order to receive approval from participating organizations for required support of the IPY satellite data processing overhead, and is also needed in order to anticipate volumes of data, mission planning and data distribution demand. Furthermore, these may be needed to secure remote sensing data needs in advance of requests for funding from the appropriate National or EU funding bodies. Due to the anticipated volume of IPY data acquisition requests, it may be important to consider establishing and IPY interdisciplinary coordination or satellite data acquisition planning group(s) to streamline and consolidate independent overlapping and/or complementary data requests. This will make the optimisation of the complex mission planning aspects more efficient.",

The pace of development has increased significantly in recent years as the price of oil and gas has risen, motivating industry to travel further north to extract fossil fuels for global consumption. Increasing pressure from various governments - Russian, Norwegian, Canadian and Americans - require the Arctic to be open for business. Increasingly, Arctic communities are being tied into the global market for oil and gas, putting pressure on their individual and societal capacities to cope with change, participate in resource management decision-making, and secure any possible economic and social benefits. As such, the urgent pace of such development poses critical challenges to the human security of communities, affecting local economies, traditional livelihoods, health, food, and the environment. At the same time traditional securities are increasing in pressure from sovereignty issues to reducing dependencies upon Middle East oil and gas supplies.\nA growing body of research and policy work on human security already exists [UNDP, 1994; Canada, 2005; Hoogensen, 2005]. However, little work to date has been conducted on the unique challenges to human security in the Arctic context. Human security attempts to recognize the (in)securities of human beings in a variety of contexts, ranging from health and food security to identity, economic and environmental securities. Oil and gas development from a securities perspective can be seen both positively and negatively, exposing Arctic communities to threats as well as opportunities. This framework provides a vehicle for the expression of vulnerabilities and adaptabilities from the grassroots level, such that individuals and communities themselves can determine what is important to their own sense of security. The need for such comprehensive, participatory research on the impacts of oil and gas development in Arctic communities has been well articulated (AHDR 2004; ACIA 2005; AIL 2005; AIP 2005; ICARP II 2005).\nThis timely research seeks to understand how oil and gas development impacts the security of Arctic communities, both for themselves as well as in relation to more traditional state-based securities requiring access and exploitation of resources. GAPS is a multidisciplinary project, joining social and natural scientists together, along with participating local communities and organizations, to gather and analyze data on oil and gas development in the Arctic region using a multiple securities approach. The project explores a number of the traditional and human security and environmental relationships in the Arctic and demonstrates the importance of the region to the development of security concepts in relation to environmental change.\nResearch project objectives:\nExpand upon current understandings of human and traditional/state securities in the Arctic and their linkages to climate change;\nExplore the meaning of security in Arctic communities and develop an understanding of the factors contributing to (in)securities as they are identified by community members;\nConsider how local knowledge exposes (in)securities that have been thus far neglected or overlooked by scientific and policy communities;\nExplore new potentials for local adaptabilities previously overlooked by research and policy communities;\nAssess the interrelationships between major processes of change in the Arctic (including climate, societal, economic, ecological) and their combined impacts on human security in the region;\nExplore new possibilities for community engagement in research in the Arctic and further strengthen university-community research linkages;\nFacilitate communication and collaboration between circumpolar communities;\nDevelop grassroots indicators and methods to assess the impacts of oil and gas development on human security in the Arctic;\nEmploy innovative methods of data collection and research dissemination (i.e. film and video) to facilitate community access to, and involvement in, the research; and,\nProvide the basis for Masters and PhD thesis research for participating graduate students.",

The lack of existing information in key regions of the EAIS is a consequence of its remoteness and inaccessibility. The acquisition of these essential data can only be accomplished by long-range airborne surveys requiring a level of international collaboration and commitment of resources that has been unavailable to the scientific community for over 25 years.\n\nWe propose to coordinate an internationally collaborative program of long-range aero-geophysical survey, during the period of the IPY, over the historically inaccessible subglacial highlands and lowlands of East Antarctica. Our proposed survey will be managed collaboratively by scientists from the US, UK, Germany and Australia with the advice of an International Steering Committee (ISC) implemented via SCAR's scientific research program named Antarctic Climate Evolution (ACE, EoI #37). Funding for this project will be sought from the US National Science Foundation and the UK National Environmental Research Council. The aerogeophysical surveys will be accomplished over two field seasons using a US Naval Research Laboratory P-3 Orion aircraft operating out of McMurdo Station (EoI #256).\n\nThe survey targets will be focused on regions critical to understanding contemporary and previous ice sheet dynamics and change and include subglacial highlands and lowlands of Domes A and C beneath the central EAIS. The region of our proposed ice penetrating radar, lidar, gravity and magnetics survey include the enigmatic Aurora Subglacial Basin as well as the majority of the Gamburtsev, Vostok and Belgica subglacial highlands.\n\nThe deeply depressed Aurora Subglacial Basin is a region of considerable importance to the form and stability of ice in East Antarctica. It hosts a catchment many times larger than that of the Pine Island/Thwaites Glacier system of West Antarctica and satellite remote sensing has recently revealed dramatic ice surface lowering in the region. It is possible that ice discharge from the Aurora Basin dominates Antarctica's contemporary ice loss to the ocean.\n\nThe highlands of the central Antarctic Plate beneath Domes A and C of the EAIS currently support an extensive network of subglacial lakes and have been the nursery for paleo ice sheets at least since the early Oligocene separation of Australia and East Antarctica. It is possible that the Gamburtsev Mountains have been the most intensely and continuously glaciated crustal elements on Earth.\n\nThe specific objectives of these internationally coordinated surveys will be: \n\n1) to provide bedrock elevation, ice sheet thickness, surface elevation, surface accumulation, englacial structure, basal melt rates and thermal structure necessary for modeling ice sheet (and subglacial lake) evolution and future change; \n\n2) to constrain geothermal flux and determine the location, properties and connectivity of the subglacial sedimentary and hydrological units critical to understanding ice sheet evolution (and subglacial habitats); \n\n3) to characterize subglacial lithology, identify crustal boundaries and estimate crustal rebound for the central Antarctic Plate; and \n\n4) to identify any 'preserved' glacial geomorphology and map fault scarps indicative of Cenozoic (or older) tectonic processes.\n\nThese objectives and target areas are of interest to a broad spectrum of disciplines within the international scientific community. The many collaborating investigators in this activity represent a broad sampling of expertise from glaciology, including both remote sensing and ice sheet modeling, as well as geology and geophysics. In addition to its primary focus of understanding the cryospheric evolution of the EAIS through support of ice sheet modeling, this work will contribute substantially to both Antarctic subglacial lake exploration (EoI #876) and knowledge of the enigmatic Gamburtsev Mountains (EoI #384).",

It seeks to develop and maintain a global ocean Temperature-Salinity resource with data that are both up-to-date and of the highest quality possible. Making global measurements of ocean temperature and salinity (T-S) quickly and easily accessible to users is the primary goal of the GTSPP. Both real-time data transmitted over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS), and delayed-mode data received by the NODC are acquired and incorporated into a continuously managed database.  Countries contributing to the project are Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, and the United States. Canada's Marine Environmental Data Service (MEDS) leads the project, and has the operational responsibility to gather and process the real-time data. MEDS accumulates real-time data from several sources via the GTS. They check the data for several types of errors, and remove duplicate copies of the same observation before passing the data on to NODC. The quality control procedures used in GTSPP were developed by MEDS, who also coordinated the publication of those procedures through the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). The U.S. NODC performs four functions for the GTSPP: \nMaintains the global database of temperature and salinity data and provides online access to the data. \nAdds realtime data supplied by MEDS to the database. \nProcesses delayed mode copies of data by performing the same data quality tests as MEDS, then adds data to the database. \nPrepares monthly data sets and transfers them by network to participants in the U.S., Australia and France, as well as to requestors. \nIn addition to MEDS and NODC, three science centers participate in the project by independently evaluating the delayed-mode data sets for the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. Australia&#039;s Commonwealth Scientific, Industrial and Research Organization (CSIRO), the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), and NOAA&#039;s Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) perform this function as Data Assembly Centers for the World Ocean Circulation Program, which GTSPP supports. \n\nInformation provided by http://ioc.unesco.org/oceanteacher/OceanTeacher2/01_GlobOcToday/06_OpOc/04_GOOS/04_GlobSys/GTSPP/gtspp.htm",

            "definition": "The Ross Sea, a marginal Antarctic sea south of New Zealand, has been\nstudied since the days of the Scott/Amundsen expeditions. It is the\nsite of extensive penguin, bird and mammal colonies, and also the home\nof two significant scientific bases, McMurdo Station (US) and Stazione\nBaia de Terra Nova (Italy). Its oceanography is relatively well known,\nincluding ... the physical oceanography and hydrography, nutrient\nconcentrations (nitrate and silicic acid), and phytoplankton biomass\nand species composition. However, marked variations in these variables\noccur spatially and temporally. Indeed, the variations with time are\nthe greatest factor in the Ross Sea habitat. For example, throughout\nmuch of the winter the Ross Sea is ice covered, and no incident\nradiation is available to drive photosynthesis. In contrast, during\nthe summer months the Ross Sea is ice-free, and large accumulations of\nphytoplankton biomass occur.\n\nIn addition to these seasonal changes, variations among years occur in\nall oceanographic variables, whether they be current velocities and\ndirections, ice concentration, winds, or phytoplankton\nproductivity. The causes and consequences of these interannual\nvariations, however, are poorly known. They likely have both local and\nremote drivers; that is, ice concentrations are likely controlled by\nthe Antarctic circumpolar wave observed by White et al. (1999), as\nwell as by basin-wide changes induced by El Nino. Regardless of the\ncauses, the degree of variation among years in biological variables is\nunknown, and this is what IVARS seeks to explore. Ultimately we hope\nto understand not only the causes, but also the consequences to the\nfood web of the region.\n\nHow will we assess the interannual differences in biological\nprocesses? We first will collect as much historical data from the\nregion from various cruises conducted in the past three decades and\ngenerate a climatology or long-term mean of both nutrients (nitrate\nand silicic acid) and chlorophyll concentrations. This will enable us\nto compare results collected during our cruises to assess the degree\nof variation from those observed earlier. The second approach is to\ncollect, from a pre-defined sampling grid, nutrient and phytoplankton\ninformation using standard ship-board sampling procedures. Two cruises\nper year are planned: one in mid- to late-December (the period of\nmaximum productivity and phytoplankton biomass), and one in\nmid-February (the end of the growing season). A total of five field\nseasons will be undertaken, with the first in 2001-2002 having been\nalready completed. By comparing the nitrate data from each cruise to\nthat of 'pre-bloom' water (found prior to phytoplankton growth early\nin the growing season), seasonal productivity can be calculated and\ncompared with that of previous years, hence quantifying the\ninterannual variations in seasonal productivity.\n\nThe third component of IVARS is the deployment of two moorings, each\nwith an elaborate suite of instruments designed to investigate the\nproximate causes of the limitation of phytoplankton growth. The\nlocations of the moorings are placed where historically there are two\ndifferent phytoplankton assemblages. The first (Calinectes), located\nnorth of Ross Island, is normally dominated by diatoms, whereas the\nsecond (Xiphias) is dominated by the haptophyte Phaeocystis\nantarctica. These phytoplankton types have extremely different roles\nin the local food web and biogeochemical cycles. Each mooring will\nhave the following instruments on it: a fast repetition rate\nfluorometer (FRRF), a nitrate analyzer, a silicic acid analyzer, a\nwhole water sampler, two additional fluorometers, a sediment trap,\nthermistors, a CTD, and current meters. The aim of each mooring is to\nprovide continuous sampling of the surface layer properties to get a\nclosely spaced measurement of the variations within each growing\nseason. In addition, the FRRF gives an assessment of the degree of\nlimitation by inorganic nutrients. It has been shown that iron becomes\nlimiting in the austral summer (e.g., Olson et al., 2000), although\nthe extent and onset of this limitation is unknown. Using the FRRF\nwill give a sensitive measure of the degree of iron limitation through\ntime. The nitrate data will allow for continuous estimates of seasonal\nproduction (and its short-term variations), and the silicic acid\nmeasurements will allow for the estimation of diatom productivity (as\nPhaeocystis antarctica does not use silica). Diatoms are often\nconsidered to be more strongly iron limited than other species, but it\nis uncertain if this is true in the Ross Sea. Furthermore, the ratio\nof nitrate:silicate uptake is another indicator of iron stress in\ndiatoms, and will provide a separate estimate from the bulk community\nmeasurements provided by the FRRF. Finally, the sediment trap will\nallow estimates of the losses of organic material through the water\ncolumn, which can be compared to productivity and biomass estimates to\nconstruct a one-dimensional budget of nitrogen (Smith and Asper,\n2000).\n\nUsing this three-tiered approach, we hope to accurately assess the\nvariations in several important variables of the Ross Sea, and their\nrelationships to the food web of the region as well as to large-scale\nforcing. Hopefully this record will also allow for an assessment of\nsubtle changes that might occur in future years in response to global\nclimate change. Such changes have already been observed in the\nhydrographic conditions of the region (e.g., Jacobs et al., 2002), but\nthis would be the first attempt to relate biological responses of the\nlower portion of the food web to large-scale changes in surface layer\nproperties that occur as a result of climate changes.",

Changes in the biomass of terrestrial ecosystems will likely affect the permafrost, active layer, carbon reserves, trace-gas fluxes, hydrological systems, biodiversity, wildlife populations and the habitability of the Arctic. Changes in green biomass can be expected across the entire bioclimate gradient from treeline to the coldest parts of the Arctic. The Greening of the Arctic (GOA) initiative consists of a group of scientists who are part of four major components. \n\nThe first component will examine in detail the 24-year record of greenness across the entire circumpolar Arctic as measured by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using satellite imagery (AVHRR and MODIS). The study will examine historical trends in NDVI and document areas of major increases or decreases in the NDVI and link these trends to changes in sea-ice distribution, land-surface-temperatures, snow-cover, bioclimate subzones, vegetation type, glacial history, and other variables in a circumpolar GIS database that is part of the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM). Modeling studies will use the past trends in NDVI to predict future distribution of arctic vegetation using the BIOME4 model. Transient dynamics of the vegetation will be examined using the ArcVeg model. The project will focus along a North American Arctic Transect (NAAT) where extensive ground data are available. This component is already funded by NSF.\n\nThe second component will examine NDVI-ecosystem relationships along transects in North America and Eurasia at zonal sites in all 5 arctic bioclimate subzones. This portion of the study will take advantage of the existing NAAT that currently consists of 20 research sites in Alaska and Canada (Toolik Lake to Howe Island in Alaska, and Inuvik to Isachsen in Canada) that are part of several ongoing research projects. A similar transect through all five bioclimate subzones has been proposed for the Yamal Peninsula region in Russia, extending to Svalbard in the extreme High Arctic, the Eurasian Arctic Transect (EAT). The Russian part of the study is linked to the Circumpolar Arctic Rangifer Monitoring and Assessment (CARMA) project, and will examine the linkages between greening trends, the range and forage for the reindeers of the Nenets people, and the regional sea-ice conditions. The Russian component has been proposed to the NASA/USDA Land Cover Land-Use Change initiative. \n\nThe third component will address the collection of ground biomass and site characterization along the NAAT and EAT transects. This will provide a legacy of the data and infrastructure along the full arctic climate gradient at representative sites in each arctic bioclimate subzone in western Canada and on the Yamal Peninsula-Svalbard transect. Standard protocols and field manual for biomass collection, and other site characterization will be developed. The biomass protocols will be developed in concert with researchers at other established sites such as existing CALM and ITEX sites and flagship observatories to expand the network of biomass collection sites. \n\nAn outreach/education component of the project will develop a web-based Arctic Geobotanical Atlas (AGA) that will use a variety of tools to help students, educators, scientists, land managers, and the public to understand issues related to the greening of the Arctic. Users will be able to download and use online GIS data from the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map and maps at several sites along the GOA transects, in combination with other remote-sensing products. This component is already funded by an NSF grant. Educational application of the AGA in the classroom will be proposed at a later date. Linkage of the project to the University of the Arctic and Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) will also occur in relationship to the human dimensions aspects of the project.",

The Indonesian province East Kalimantan was the area\nworst hit by the burning. Since then, fire has been a recurring\nfeature on the island of Borneo, burning large areas in 1986, 1991,\n1994 and 1997/98. In 1997/98, the fires again hit East Kalimantan very\nhard, an estimated 5.2 mio ha of land was burned during this time. The\nhaze from these fires covered the South East Asian region for weeks,\ncausing health problems, disruption to shipping and aviation,\nculminating in the closure of international airports. Economic losses\nand ecological damage were enormous.\n\nWildfires in Indonesia are almost always human caused. A large\npercentages of all wildfires result from escaped land-clearing fires,\nor are a result of land use conflicts and land speculation. Fire is\nthe most common tool used by smallholders as well as for the agro- and\nforest industries to prepare the land. Increasingly Indonesia's fire\nand haze problem is being ascribed to large-scale forest conversion\nand land clearing activities (pulp wood, rubber tree and oil palm\nplantations). The fires can be ascribed as a symptom for the under\nlying problems of land use planning as well as conflicts over land\nuse. Without solving these issues fire management will not be\nsuccessful. An extreme fire season usually occurs every 3-5 years,\nwhen the climate in Indonesia becomes exceptionally dry due to the 'El\nNi?o Southern Oscillation'.\n\nProject Description:\n\nDuring Phase I (1994-1997) of IFFM, an appropriate level of fire\nprotection, training needs, suitable equipment, necessary fire\nintelligence, institutional and structural support were\nevaluated and determined in a pilot area. Cooperation with\nrelevant government agencies and timber concessionaires has\nbeen ongoing. At the village level, socio-economic studies\nhave been carried out to elaborate a concept of\ncommunity-based fire management and to organise volunteer fire\nresponse crews. Fire prevention material has been produced to\nraise public awareness. Since the second phase, the scheme\ndetermined in the Bukit Soeharto pilot area has been\nreplicated in other areas of East Kalimantan. Local fire\ncentres at all the 10 Cabang Dinas Kehutanan (District Forest\nOffices) as well as National Parks are being established and\nequipped, and personnel at all levels trained to prevent and\nrespond to wildfires. These local fire centres will form the\ncore of a fire management system for the!  province. The\nprovincial fire centre in Samarinda, located at DINAS\nKehutanan, will coordinate fire management activities in East\nKalimantan. It will collect information from the local\noffices, provide fire intelligence (fire hot spot locations,\nfire danger rating, radio communications) and coordinate the\nsharing of equipment and fire-fighting personnel between fire\nstations.\n\n      Contact:\n\n      Integrated Forest Fire Management Project (IFFM)\n      Jl.

The field work is already happening as various independent projects in different northern North American jurisdictions (both Canada and United States), operating under northern leadership and direction. These projects will continue to operate in a similar manner if endorsed as an official IPY Activity. Thus the following Activity Summary refers to the work in general, rather than in project-specific terms.\nIn 1997/98, ancient organic artifacts and biological remains, particularly large quantities of caribou dung, were first found melting out of an alpine ice patch in southern Yukon, Canada (Kuyzk, et al., 1999, Arctic 52-2:214-219). The following year, 1999, the remains of Kwaday Dan Ts’inchi meaning “Long Ago Person Found” in Southern Tutchone (Athapaskan) were found melting out of a glacier in Tatshenshini-Alsek Park in adjacent northwestern British Columbia, Canada (Beattie et al.,, 2000, Canadian Journal of Archaeology 24:129-147).\nIn 1999, more artifacts and biological remains were found at other melting south Yukon ice patches. Within a few summer field seasons of research, significant specimens and samples (paleo-biological, or paleobiological and archaeological) were identified and/or collected from more than 70 mountain-top ice patches in the latter jurisdiction. Radiocarbon dating indicated that the frozen organic remains being recovered from the Yukon ice patch sites spanned the entire Holocene period (Farnell et al., 2004, Arctic 57-3:247-259. Hare et al., 2004, Arctic 57-3:260-272).\nThe banking and curation of the samples/specimens recovered as a result of the Yukon ice patch work has been coordinated by the Yukon Government (Renewable Resources, and Heritage-Archaeology) with local study and analysis of materials, as well as research and identification work by collaborating scientists from other institutions. Studies related to the ancient artifacts have included feather identification and analysis by staff of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington (Dove, et al., 2005, Arctic 58-1:38-43), and paint analysis by staff of the Canadian Conservation Institute in Ottawa (Helwig et al., unpublished). Studies related to the biological specimens have been wide-ranging, including: research on species, particularly caribou, genetic history through mtDNA research; caribou dietary analysis; industrial contaminants analysis; parasite history; pollen and vegetation history; ice patch shrinkage over time; etc. (Farnell et al., ibid.).\nThe Kwaday Dan Ts’inchi project is also locally administered, with the concerned indigenous government, the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, jointly managing the project with the province. The provincial museum (Royal British Columbia Museum), the Provincial Parks’ department, as well as scientists based in Canada, Germany, and Scotland are working with the community on the study and interpretation of this find, and the materials recovered there-from, with results now being published (e.g., Monsalve et al., 2002, American Journal of Physical Anthropology 119-3:288-291; Dickson et al., 2004, Holocene 14-4:481-486; Mudie et al., 2005, Canadian Journal of Botany 83:111-123; Richards et al., in press, American Antiquity). Both the discovery and the manner in which this unique find is being managed continue to receive international attention; the project is often pointed out as an example of how scientists and First Nations can work together on even the most sensitive of subject areas, human remains.\nColleagues began fieldwork in adjacent Alaska in 2001, continuing in 2003, attempting to find glacier or ice patch archaeological sites in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. This work involved the development of a predictive model for identifying locations that should be targeted in the search for archaeological and/or biological specimens in these frozen landscapes (Dixon et al., 2005, American Antiquity 70-1:129-143). In 2003, state archaeologists successfully identified ice patch archaeological sites in the Tangle Lakes (Denali Highway) area of the state (Vanderhoek et al., in press, Alaska Journal of Anthropology). Fieldwork has continued in this location and elsewhere in the state, with ongoing analysis of the recovered materials.\nThe identification of ice patch sites yielding biological and cultural specimens and samples began in the Mackenzie Mountains region of Northwest Territories, Canada in 2005, with positive results (Andrews, 2005 communication to Activity leader). Plans are underway to search for ice patch sites in the Atlin area of northern British Columbia, Canada in 2006 (French, 2005 communication to Activity leader). Archaeological survey to search for specimens melting out of glaciers in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska, U.S. is also to be initiated in 2006 (Howell, 2005 communication to Activity leader).\nFieldwork to find and recover the specimens and samples melting out of the glaciers and ice patches in northwestern North America, as well as to study the melting phenomena themselves, takes place during the height of the summer melt season each August. The fieldwork is generally conducted as day trips or short excursions, relying on helicopters for logistic support; over-view (fixed wing) flights have also been found to be useful.\nThe materials being recovered from these frozen contexts include ancient artifacts, biological materials such as small bird and animal remains, dung from different species but predominantly caribou in the case of the ice patch sites, plant macro and micro remains, and ice block samples. The specimens collected are often fragile and following field documentation, in many cases must be quickly transferred to refrigerated storage to prevent deterioration. After recovery, the specimens and samples are curated in local government facilities whenever possible; professional Conservators are stabilizing the more fragile and significant artifact pieces. Laboratory work to study both the biological and archaeological specimens and samples recovered during these projects is being undertaking by government researchers based in the north, where-ever possible, working in collaboration with scientists/specialists at southern institutions.\nThe local communities are involved, as well, in the study and interpretation of the recovered materials. For example, funds are being sought to document traditional indigenous knowledge related to the unique archaeological finds being collected by the Yukon Ice Patch project. Research to document the traditional aboriginal use of these landscapes is also part of the some of the projects. Museum displays on some of the finds are already in place, e.g., Kwaday Dan Ts’inchi at the Royal British Columbia Museum, and more are in the works.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=435",

The higher ocean resolution of HadCM3 is a major factor in this; other factors include a good match between the atmospheric and oceanic components; and an improved ocean mixing scheme (Gent and McWilliams). HadCM3 has been run for over a thousand years, showing little drift in its surface climate.\n\nHadCM3 is composed of two components: the atmospheric model HadAM3 and the ocean model (which includes a sea ice model). Simulations often use a 360-day calendar, where each month is 30 days.\n\nSummer provided by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HadCM3",

            "definition": "Project Background NASA/UDSA MOU:\n\t\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to strengthen future collaboration. In support of this collaboration, NASA and the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) jointly funded a new project to assimilate NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and products into an existing decision support system (DSS) operated by the International Production Assessment Division (IPAD) of FAS. Building on NASA's investment in the MODIS Science Team, the project is implementing a user-friendly system that will allow for the integration and analysis of MODIS data products in IPAD's DSS.\n\nFAS Mission and Tasks:\n\t\nFAS promotes the security and stability of U.S. food supply, improves foreign market access for U.S. agricultural products, reports on world food security, and advises the U.S. government on international food aid requirements.\n\nFAS bears the primary responsibility for USDA's overseas activities: market development, international trade agreements and negotiations, and the collection and analysis of statistics and market information. It also administers USDA's export credit guarantee and food aid programs, and helps increase income and food availability in developing nations by mobilizing expertise for agriculturally led economic growth.\n\nIPAD's Scope:\n\t\nThe FAS, through IPAD, provides agricultural information for global food security. It produces objective, timely and regular assessments of global agricultural production outlook and the conditions affecting food security. IPAD is responsible for global crop condition assessments and estimates of production and yield of grains, oilseeds, and cotton. IPAD assessments are an integral component of the monthly crop assessments issued by USDA's World Agricultural Outlook Board - a primary source for agricultural information worldwide.\n\t\nThe Application of NASA EOS MODIS Data to FAS Agricultural Assessment and Forecasting:\n\t\nTo meet its objectives, FAS/IPAD uses satellite data and data products to monitor agriculture worldwide and to locate and keep track of natural disasters such as short and long term droughts, floods and persistent snow cover which impair agricultural productivity. FAS is the largest user of satellite imagery in the non-military sector of the U.S. government. For the last 20 years FAS has used a combination of Landsat and NOAA-AVHRR satellite data to monitor crop condition and report on episodic events.\n\nFAS is upgrading and enhancing the satellite component of its IPAD decision support system through an information delivery system for MODIS data and derived products. NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board two platforms of the Earth Observing System (EOS), was designed in part to monitor subtle vegetation responses to stress, vegetation production and land cover with regional-to-global coverage. Hence, integration of MODIS data and derived products into the IPAD FAS DSS provides FAS with better characterization of land surface conditions at the regional scale and enables monitoring of changes in the key agricultural areas of FAS focus regions in a more timely fashion and at a higher resolution than previously possible with NOAA-AVHRR data.\n\nMODIS: An Operational Prototype: \n\t\nAlthough MODIS is a NASA experimental mission, the instrument's capabilities will be extended by the launch of the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) in 2008, part of the National Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), which will become fully operational in 2009. Thus the methods and system developed through this research project can be transitioned into a fully operational domain. \n\nProject Components:\n\n- Delivery and integration of MODIS Rapid Response data into the FAS monitoring system to facilitate improved monitoring of the impact of climate hazards, such as drought, large scale flooding, and snow storms, on agricultural production.\n\n- Development and delivery of a long term database of MODIS composite Vegetation Index (VI) time series including analysis tools and a graphic user interface that provides mosaicking, reprojection capabilities, and easy access to the moderate resolution image archive.\n\n- Establishment of the relationship between MODIS VI data and the long-term archives from the AVHRR and SPOT-VEGETATION used by FAS/IPAD.\n\n- Development of enhanced MODIS cropland products including a crop mask, a crop type map, new band combination products, and a crop stress index.\n\nProject Website: http://www.pecad.fas.usda.gov/glam.cfm\n\n[Summary provided by the United States Department of Agriculture.]",

The network seeks to establish in the Arctic and Antarctic the framework conditions for collaborative projects between artists, scientists, tactical media workers and engineers within three major topical fileds i.e. migration, weather and climate and communications. This is envisaged through the installation and maintenance of two mobile open source and creative commons based art and science research facilities in the Arctic and Antarctica between 2007-2009 and further operations in the next decade. We will be also constructing and launching a micro-satellite in the high sun-synchronous elliptical orbit in 2008 to enable research and contact between the two stations and the sharing of sensor data with other IPY clusters. The facility planned for the Arctic Circle is MAKROLAB mkVII, an autonomous, minimal environmental impact communications, research and living unit capable of sustaining up to 8 crew members for long periods of work in isolation/insulation conditions (60-180 days). Onboard renewable-energy systems, bioreactor/biological sewage processing, water recycling systems, satellite and HF communication systems and radar infrastructure, developed during previous manifestations of the project, will be augmented to fully winterize the MAKROLAB and provide its crews with the tools/resources needed to conduct joint or independent work in concentrated polar field-research environments. Operational systems researched/developed during the MAKROLAB Arctic phases will be applied to the design and construction of a new rapid-deployment zero environmental impact polar research station with the working title LADOMIR, which will be tested in Antarctica in the southern summers of 2008 and 2009. LADOMIR is named for the utopian poem written in 1920 by the Russian Futurist Velimir Khlebnikov, which describes the universal landscape of the future through the destruction of the old world and its synthesis in the new. The word is a combination of LAD, meaning both harmony and living creature,and MIR, both peace and world, universe. Adopting the related constructivist notion of FAKTURA, which can be understood as the conferring of tactile and sensorial qualities onto abstract artistic or scientific elements, LADOMIR will be dedicated to producing readable/tangible surfaces which the public will be able to use to reflect on vague or otherwise invisible polar systems and scientific data from Antarctica and the Arctic. Telecommunications, weather and climate systems and migration are seen as three multiple-dynamic global energy systems which can be explored to understand how our planet functions on natural, social and technological levels, and the knowledge inherent in each can in turn be applied as primary sources for new cognitive and evolutionary strategies. We envision the LADOMIR-MAKROLAB interpolar complex to function as an aggregator and visualiser of self produced and IPY share derived data sources in a manner that transverses from the scientific to the artistic and creative and is thus understandable to a different, non scientific public. A very important aspect of the project is to bring the experience and knowledge of indigenous Arctic cultures to the new Antarctic cultures (and vice/versa) through a dynamic, live and archived communications system. Other activities connected to the projects will include the launching and servicing of stratospheric balloons; the development and operation of a fleet of UAV for remote observation; the development of open source software and hardware for data gathering, processing and intuitive display in the arts and sciences; and the development of autonomous, zero-impact sensor and data relay systems.",

This program, known as the International Polar Motion Service, was initiated in 1899 with the establishment of six stations, all located near the parallel of 39 degrees 08 minutes north latitude (to permit uniform computations), and were at Gaithersburg, Maryland; Cincinnati, Ohio; Ukiah, California; Mizusawa, Japan; Charjui in Russian Turkestan; and Carloforte, Sardinia, Italy. Economic constraints forced the closing of the Cincinnati observatory in 1932. The Charjui station was lost in World War I, and an observatory was substituted for it at Kitab, near Samarkand in the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Gaithersburg Observatory was constructed by Edwin Smith, Chief of the Instrument Division of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (This agency, now the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, operated the International Polar Motion Service observatories in the United States.) Between 1891 and 1892 Smith had been conducting measurements of the variation of latitude on a volunteer basis from his home in Rockville, Maryland, and made nearly 1800 individual measurements on 146 nights, until his regular work forced him to discontinue his observations. However, when the International Geodetic Association allocated funds for the purchase of land in Gaithersburg in 1898, Smith was entrusted with the construction of the Gaithersburg Observatory, which began operating on October 18, 1899.\n\nThe original six observatories around the world worked in close concert carrying out a program of star study selected by Dr. Kimura, the astronomer in charge of the Mizusawa station. Twelve groups of stars, each containing six pairs of stars, were selected. Two groups of stars were observed each night at each station in accordance with a schedule of dates, time, and duration prepared by Dr. Kimura. The irregular daily motion of the earth's axis was believed to be extremely small, but the extent could be determined by the precise measurements of the stars. The six stations worked documenting the data to support latitude variations until 1914. Economic constraints forced the closing of the Gaithersburg and Cincinnati stations in 1915. During World War I contact was lost with the Charjui station. When communication with the Russian observers was resumed, the association learned that star movement data had been recorded through 1919. After World War I the Soviets continued to participate in this program with the establishment of a new station in Kitab in Uzbekistan, USSR.\n\nWhile the Cincinnati station remained closed and was eventually dismantled, the Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory resumed operations in 1932. Upon reopening, it functioned continually in cooperation with its sister observatories through out the world until computerization rendered its use obsolete in 1982.\n\nThe scientific work conducted at the Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory illustrates the systematic approach sought by the International Geodetic Association to measure the degree of 'wobble' occurring on the earth' s north-south axis. Although superseded by newer technologies using satellite observations the wealth of data returned from Gaithersburg and the other five observatories is used by scientists today to determine polar motion; the size, shape and physical properties of the earth; to predict climate and earthquakes; and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites.\n\nThe city of Gaithersburg designated the observatory as a local historic site in December 1983. In July 1985 the site was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The observatory property was conveyed to the city of Gaithersburg in May 1987 by the federal government, with the proviso that it be preserved as a historic monument and used for the benefit of the public. At the present time the city of Gaithersburg plans to restore the latitude observatory and build a science education center, on the site of the caretaker's house, for the use of the school children of Gaithersburg.\n\nSummary Provided By: http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/butowsky5/astro4i.htm",

Since the IGY (1957-58), biologists have made impressive progress in understanding the Antarctic ichthyofauna. However, research integration into the broader marine context has been limited, largely due to lack of access to Sub-Antarctic fishes. These fishes, in particular those of the dominant suborder Notothenioidei, are critical for a complete understanding of the evolution, population dynamics, eco-physiology and eco-biochemistry of their Antarctic relatives. \n\nThe ICEFISH programme is designed to fill these critical gaps in our knowledge. Cruises, encompassing the South Atlantic, South Pacific and South Indian Ocean sectors constitute the ICEFISH programme, the first comprehensive international survey of the Sub-Antarctic marine habitat. The first, ICEFISH-2004 (17 May -17 July 2004) was a resounding success. Extensive fishing was performed in the South Atlantic sector: Burwood Banks, Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas, Shag Rock, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands, Bouvetoya, and Tristan de Cunha, at depths ranging from tidepools to the abyss (for information on the cruise, participants, and detailed science projects, see www.icefish.neu.edu). \n\nAlthough autonomous, ICEFISH-2007 builds on the important legacy of ICEFISH-2004. It will sample the Sub-Antarctic Pacific sector, including Campbell and Scott Islands, Antipodes, Auckland, Macquarie, and Balleny Islands. Fishing will be multi-modal, using Otter, mid-water, Blake and MOCNESS trawls, plankton nets, beach seining, tide pooling, and traps. We will charter a suitable ice-strengthened ship/icebreaker, equipped with aquaria with running seawater to maintain live specimens, and with high-quality research laboratories. Twenty-four to 28 scientists will participate, largely those of the 2004 cruise, ensuring continuity of the scientific focus of the ICEFISH programme. The scientific activity will cover a wide range of topics, many of which will develop work carried out in ICEFISH-2004. We will summarise some of these topics: \n\n- Systematics and evolutionary studies to relate Sub-Antarctic notothenioids to their Antarctic relatives through morphological, molecular and cytological analyses. The diversity of habitats and attendant species likely to be collected in ICEFISH 2007 clearly warrant such a comparative analysis, which will shed light on evolutionary diversity and radiative capacity within this sub-order. \n\n- Life history strategies and population dynamics to characterise the composition, distribution, habitat preferences and diets of the Sub-Antarctic species, and larval recruitment.\n\n- Diversity and biogeography. Documentation of fish biodiversity and possible discovery and description of unknown species, for example in the vicinity of the Balleny Islands and Scott Island (CCAMLR Statistical Subarea 88.1), where the fish fauna is poorly known. As transition zones between the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic notothenioid faunas, these islands are key to recognizing and understanding latitudinal gradients in faunal composition in the Pacific Sector of the Southern Ocean. Liparids of the Southern Hemisphere are important from an evolutionary and zoogeographic perspective; many of these species are known only from one or two specimens. In addition, new species are still being found frequently. ICEFISH-2007 would be an important opportunity to sample previously poorly sampled regions to add to knowledge of the distribution and evolution of the family. Collection at depths below 1000 m is desirable.\n\n- Physiological, biochemical and molecular-biological studies of organ and tissue systems to analyse the evolutionary basis of the adaptations of high-Antarctic nototothenioids relative to their ancestral stock.\n\n- Genomic resources for Sub-Antarctic notothenioids (nucleic-acid libraries for comparative studies of the genomes of high- and low-latitude species). Because of the causal linkage between the thermal histories of marine environment, and the waxing and waning of the antifreeze trait, the extent of the antifreeze genotypic and functional capacity in related notothenioids within and outside of the high-Antarctic is an excellent biological indicator of regional variations or changes in thermal environments in the Southern Ocean. Spleen and testis tissues will be frozen for future preparation of DNA and RNA that will be used to evaluate the antifreeze glycoprotein genotype, Erythrocytes from red-blooded species and white blood cells from icefishes will be embedded in agarose plugs and used to prepare high molecular weight DNA for the construction of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries. The BAC libraries will permit the global analysis of genome evolution of the notothenioids driven by thermal challenges.",

The question of sustainable development emphasizes the need of understanding changes not only in relation to the present, but in an inter-generational perspective. In addition the need for a gender perspective on the development process has been emphasized.\nCrucial is on one hand the need of interdisciplinarity in the research activities, because there is an intimate connections between the bio-physical, the socio-economic and the cultural worlds. And on the other hand, an understanding of the changes in inter-generational and gender perspectives is very much needed. The focus of the project will be on six major components shaping the future social characteristics of the Northern and Arctic communities.\n1) Change in resource use, technology and employment patterns. The technologification and capitalization of renewable and non-renewable resources has profound implications on both the sectors and the communities. Similarly the technological development and its influence on the access and distribution of information, insight, knowledge and understanding, contributes to the shaping of the future through increased access by Arctic residents to the global flow of information, as well as access for outsiders to a more in-depth understanding of the Arctic perspectives.\n2) Change in values, power relations, perception, preferences and life strategies. The basis is the status of the living conditions, health and welfare situation characterizing the communities in the Arctic. In this process migration has a profound impact on kinship and family, just as on the children´s position in the family and society. Retrospective: Changing patterns of (gendered) social and geographical mobility. In status: Mobility, aspirations and actions: Rationalities and reasoning in relation to patterns of mobility. And Prospective: Youth Aspirations in relation to social and geographical mobility.\n3) Change in community dynamics and gender aspects of the development process, where one component is on the status of education and research activities shaping the future patterns of development, especially the question of the interaction between the two divergent processes of centralization and decentralization as components in the process. Similarly components in the ongoing changes include the regional and structural characteristics of different types of settlements such as the divide between towns and villages and the differences in perceptions of development goals.\n4) Shift in income patterns, property issues, resource rights, as well as access to decision making. A key question will be women’s access to decision making in the resource based sectors in rural areas of the north.\n5) The questions of risk, threads and crises in the development process, and how realities as well as the perceptions are influencing the social interaction in Arctic communities. On one hand the question of establishing and maintaining efficient and competent health system in sparsely populated Arctic regions including the modification and transfer of technology to quite different settings. And on the other hand the question of understanding and managing violence, both in its public and domestic forms.\n6) A cross-cutting issue - is the youth and gender perspectives on the development process, on one hand the question of participation and involvement in the social processes, and on the other hand their specific role in the processes of change, influencing both the direction and characteristics of the development process.\nA crucial topic for the consortium is the further development of the research school activities within the framework of CASS and CAES, so the list of contributors include as well members of the research consortium as well as members of the research school groups.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=210",

A companion cosmic ray surface air shower array, IceTop, will complement the detection of high energy astrophysical neutrinos and support IceCube by identifying background events. The IceCube detector will consist of approximately 80 strings of 60 digital optical modules deployed at depths between 1400 and 2400 meters. The IceTop detector will have a pair of frozen water tanks at the ice surface above each IceCube string. Each tank will have two digital optical modules to monitor cosmic ray events. The digital optical modules detect the light produced when charged particles pass through the ice, enabling the IceCube detector to track particles produced by neutrinos and IceTop to reconstruct cosmic ray events. Deployment of the first strings and surface IceTop tanks is underway now and will continue until the detector is completed in the 2009-2010 season. \n\nIceCube will open unexplored bands for astronomy, including the PeV (1015 eV) energy region, where the Universe is opaque to high energy gamma rays originating from beyond the edge of our own galaxy, and where cosmic rays do not carry directional information because of their deflection by magnetic fields. The instrument may, for example, answer the question of whether the fascinating multi-TeV photons originating in the Crab supernova remnant and near the supermassive black holes of active galaxies are of hadronic or electromagnetic origin. IceCube will provide a totally novel viewpoint on the multi-messenger astronomy of gamma ray bursts, which have been identified as a possible source of the highest energy particles in nature. \n\nIceCube also occupies a unique place in the multi-prong attack on the particle nature of dark matter, with unmatched sensitivity to cold dark matter particles approaching TeV masses. As a particle physics experiment with the capability to detect neutrinos with energies far beyond those produced at accelerators, IceCube will join the race to discover supersymmetric particles and the topological defects created in grand unified phase transitions in the early universe. The detection of cosmic neutrino beams would open the opportunity to study neutrino oscillations over Megaparsec baselines. \n\nThese exciting capabilities notwithstanding, there should be no doubt the true potential of IceCube is discovery. History has not previously disappointed us: the opening of each new astronomical window has led to unexpected discoveries. Hidden particle accelerators may, for instance, exist from which only the neutrinos escape.",

            "definition": "The main objective of the proposed work is the study space and time mass variations of ice mad snow over polar regions, the estimation of the water mass balance using monthly GRACE geoids for the recent period, as well as its connection with global climate change, the global hydrological cycle, and in particular the investigation on the possible causes of the sea level rise from ice melting.\nGRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) is the first geodetic mission dedicated to the measurement of the time-variations of the Earth’s gravity field, it enables the detection of water mass transfers.\nThe on-going GRACE mission (launched in 03/2002 for a nominal lifetime of 5 years; quasi-polar orbit) provides monthly maps of tiny spatio-temporal variations of gravity due to the redistributions of mass inside the surface fluid envelops of the Earth. These satellite measurements represent vertically-integrated gravity effects of water mass reservoirs (oceans, atmosphere, continental waters and ice sheets) and of the solid Earth that need to be unravelled. Monthly solutions of the continental water storage (2002 to present) have been recently extracted from the raw GRACE geoids (at the resolution of 500 km), using an iterative generalized least-squares approach developed in our laboratory (LEGOS; Schmidt et al., 2005; Ramillien et al., 2005). After correction of important geophysical effects like mass changes induced by vertical s to study the ice sheets for the following objectives:\n\n(1) Mass balance of the ice sheets: mapping for the first time the time variations of loss/gain of ice mass observed by GRACE, in response to climate change. This will provide monthly time series and geographical maps of the integrated variations of mass over large remote regions like Antarctica and Greenland.\n\n(2) Contribution to the sea level rise: Estimating the mass balance of these polar regions, which can be further expressed in terms of sea level contribution. Recent results indicate that over the last 50 years and last 12 years, the contribution of thermal expansion of the oceans to sea level rise is 25% and 60% respectively (Cazenave and Nerem, 2004; Lombard et al., 2005a, b). For both time spans, the water mass addition to the oceans is estimated to about 1.4 mm/yr (Miller and Douglas, 2004; Lombard et al., 2005b). Recent direct estimates of mountain glaciers and ice sheets melting only explain 0.9 mm/yr (IPCC, 2005). In addition for the ice sheets (Antarctica and Greenland), these estimates based on airborne laser altimetry and other approaches are still uncertain (e.g., Thomas et al., 2004; Krabill et al., 2005). Measuring the mass balance of the ice sheets on inter-annual time scale using GRACE will represent a major improvement.\n\n(3) Snow pack changes: Another objective of this project is to monitor the snow pack changes in the Arctic regions using GRACE. Changes of the snow pack are currently monitored from space using passive microwave radiometry. However, interpretation of these observations in term of snow mass change is very difficult because of problems related to surface conditions and snow state. Here again, GRACE can provide important constraints on snow mass change at a global scale. Snow mass solutions have been recently computed from the monthly GRACE geoids made available bythe GRACE project (GFZ and CSR) using a robust inverse method of separation of hydrological signals (Ramillien et al., 2004; Ramillien et al., 2005)\n\n(4) Monitoring of the permafrost: GRACE is also able to provide information on melt of the permafrost in the boreal regions (e.g., Siberia) through associate water mass redistribution. Used in combination of water level (and discharge) measurements from satellite altimetry over Arctic rivers, GRACE data will allow us to detect and extract the permafrost signals.\n\nCazenave A and R S Nerem, Present-Day sea level change: observations and causes, Review of Geophysics, 42, RG3001, doi : 10.1029/2003RG000139, 2004.\n\nChurch, J., J.M.

After successfully being mounted and properly calibrated on the ISS, the RapidScat instrument began providing its first set of calibrated, science-quality measurements on 3 October 2014. As a bi-product of the low inclination orbit of ISS, RapidScat is in a unique position to provide measurements that are asynchronous with respect to the solar day cycle of the Earths; this translates to RapidScat having the unique capability (in contrast to all other past and present space-borne scatterometers) of observing diurnal and semi-diurnal variability over seasonal time scales. The ISS-RapidScat mission is particularly blessed to have contemporaneous measurements from QuikSCAT (albeit limited due to QuikSCAT's fixed antenna position) as a way to ensure consistently calibrated measurements to ensure accurate observation and continued study of the coupled Earth climate system. The PO.DAAC functions as the primary archive and distribution center for the RapidScat data produced directly by the ISS-RapidScat Science Data Systems (SDS) team at JPL.",

The campaign was comprised of two phases: the first centered on the U.S. west coast, providing tests primarily for the ABI instrument, and the second focused on the central and eastern U.S. with tests primarily for the GLM instrument. Airborne measurements were taken using NASA’s\nER-2 aircraft, equipped with spectrometer, radar, lidar, radiometer, and other atmospheric observation instruments to assist with ABI and GLM validation.

The coastal zones, which include some\nof the most diverse and productive marine ecosystems, such as coral\nreefs, seagrass beds, mangrove forests, tidal mudflats, and kelp\nforests, are particularly important and vulnerable. WCMC's marine\nprogramme aims to compile information on these ecosystems and the\nconservation of the species which they harbour. A number of ongoing\nprojects contribute to the overall programme:\n\nCoral Reefs Since the publication, in 1988 of the 3-volume Coral Reefs\nof the World WCMC has been acclaimed as a centre of expertise in these\nimportant ecosystems. In support of ReefBase, a project run by the\nInternational Center for Living Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM)\nin Manila, WCMC has been developing digital maps of coral reefs of the\nworld. Draft maps have been prepared for all countries and for 45, the\nreefs have now been mapped at scales of 1:250,000 or better. These\nmaps have been incorporated into the CD of Reefbase, a highly detailed\ndatabase first released in 1996. These maps are also available on\nInternet at the following address\nhttp://www.wcmc.org.uk/marine/data/.\nThe use of GIS for storing the data has enabled the calculation of\nglobal and regional estimates of reef area.\n\nMangrove Atlas In association with the International Society for\nMangrove Ecosystems and the International Tropical Timber\nOrganization, WCMC has recently completed work on a World Mangrove\nAtlas, published in 1997.\n\nMangrove Protected Areas In 1993, a survey was undertaken of protected\nareas with mangrove ecosystems. This resulted in the development\nof a database of some 1200 protected mangrove sites.\n\nPoster Map of Coral Reefs and Mangroves of the World Using mapped\ncoral reef and mangrove data, an educational poster has been\npublished, with support from BHP Ltd.\n\nMarine Protected Areas The WCMC Protected Areas Database includes some\n35,000 protected areas.\n\nThreatened and Endemic Marine Species A large number of threatened\nmarine organisms are recorded in the WCMC species database.\nData have also been exchanged with Fishbase, a global database on\nfish distribution maintained by ICLARM, and with the IUCN Coral\nReef Fish Specialist Group. Related publications include Dolphins,\nPorpoises and Whales of the World; the IUCN Red Data Book and The\nIUCN Invertebrate Red Data Book.\n\nSea Turtle Nest Sites Preliminary maps of feeding and nesting sites of\nall species of marine turtles have been produced for the world.\n\nSirenia Similar work is now being undertaken to map the global\ndistribution of Sirenians (manatees and Dugong).\n\nIPIECA and the Biodiversity Map Library Biodiversity Map Library (BML)\nis a user-interface designed to store and access a range of\nenvironmental information in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)\nformat.\n\nSeagrass Beds In collaboration with IUCN Marine Programme, a global\nsurvey of the extent and status of\nseagrass beds is planned.\n\nFor more information on the Long-term Monitoring Program\n'http://www.wcmc.org.uk/marine/projects/marine.htm' or\n'http://www.wcmc.org.uk/marine/'",

While it is developed as extensional pull apart basin in the Ross Sea embayment it is proposed here that it is expressed as dextral strike slip fault system at its northeastern end in remote Ellsworth land.\n\nRoss Sea embayment as well as Marie Byrd Land and its volcanics were studied in great detail over decades (Behrendt et al. 1991, Behrendt 1999, LeMasurier 1972, 1990, 2002, Rocchi et al. 2002). Only during the 1990s investigations of the subglacial geology were performed in restricted areas within the central WARS of the Subglacial Byrd Basin by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Airborne Gravimetry Initiative, e. g. in the CASERTZ quadrangle as well as in the area of Ice Stream D draining into the Ross Ice Shelf (Behrendt et al. 1994, 1998, Bell et al. 1998, Blankenship et al. 1993). Additional information was gathered by more recent initiatives like the ANUBIS broadband seismic experiment (Winberry and Anandakrishnan 2004). \n\nThe results of multi-disciplinary aerogeophysical surveys - that must be addressed as restricted with respect to the continental dimensions of the rift system - indicate that the southern boundary fault of WARS extends north of Whitmore Mts. towards Ellsworth Mts. (EWM) while a northern boundary fault cannot be identified clearly. The sedimentary basin with extensional horst and graben structures extends well into the Subglacial Byrd Basin and the basin is associated with active seismicity and volcanism, subglacial caldera structures indicate voluminous magmatic systems within upper crustal levels. \n\nIn order to test the model investigations are needed in Ellsworth Land, one of the least accessible and most poorly known areas in Antarctica. It stretches between Amundsen Sea, Ronne Ice Shelf and Bellingshausen Sea and encloses a triangle (see map) between Hudson Mts. at the Walgreen Coast, Sentinel Range in the Ellsworth Mountains and Eltanin Bay with the Rydberg Peninsula at the Bryan Coast. The focus of the research activities is a multi-disciplinary aerogeophysical survey within this triangle, including imaging of subglacial topography as well as the magnetic and gravity field.\n\nGround based geoscience fieldwork studies include: structural geology studies to check for indications of the regional stress field at the northern end of the Ellsworth Mts. (EWM); seismic study with temporary broadband seismic stations; GPS measurements in the Hudson Mountains (e.g. on Webber Nunatak), at Eltanin Bay (altern. Mt. Tuve) as well as at the northern end of the Sentinel Range (e.g. Mt. Weems);\nsampling for fission track dating to describe the exhumation history of individual geodynamic blocks as well as sampling for paleomagnetic studies in order to reconstruct paleopositions mapping and dating of hydroclastic eruptive features within the Bellingshausen Volcanic Provinc from Hudson Mts. in the West over Jones Mts. to Rydberg Peninsula at Bryan Coast in the East in order to deceiver ice sheet dynamics by reconstructing thicknesses of paleo-ice sheets; geo- and mineralchemistry of volcanics and enclosed mantle and crustal xenoliths in order to describe variations in magma genesis including mantle source compositions, mantle melting regimes and differentiation during ascent through the lithosphere; additional fastdrilling might provide sampling of the subglacial geology\n\nThe project of the IDs 107, 895, 276 and the ANTEC activities of Reinhard Dietrich will be initiated within the framework of the German mission to Pine Island Bay in the season 2005/06 (02-04/2006) by setting up a GPS reference point within the Hudson Mountains at Pine Island Bay as well as by initial volcanological and petrological field studies including sampling and dating the volcanic structures and their exposure ages as well as identifying the point of an eruption recorded by satellites in the Hudson Mountain Volcanic Field in 1985, which is the closest to the fastest flowing glacier in Antarctica, the Pine Island Glacier.",

Logistics will be provided to the participating scientists by national operators. Host universities/ institutes will provide training and facilities. The researchers daily needs will be funded by capacity building measures from participating international organisations.\n\nThe activity will benefit from education, communication and outreach support in order to communicate on the experiences, of the first groups of selected researchers, to a large international audience, so that there is maximum benefit gained from the activity in mobilising decision makers and potential young scientists. \n\nThe scientific activities carried out during the International Polar Year will, through a knock on effect, lead to the opening up of new disciplines in developing country universities: glaciology, meteorology, climate modelling etc. which could then be integrated into the international network of scientific research activities, thereby reinforcing the regional development of observation and modelling activities, and completing it for areas where there is little actual data.\n\nThis movement outwards would also empower scientists from the developing World and give them the feeling of being a part of global concerns, of being actively engaged in improving the future for their compatriots as well as for the wider human community.",

This study was designed to obtain time series measurements of heat content by using moored conductivity– temperature–depth (CTD) recorders and of volume transport by geostrophic calculations based on density measurements from the moored CTDs referenced to velocity measurements by moored current meters also deployed during the WIFE. Since changes in temperature and salinity of the abyssal water are small, moored CTD data must be accurately calibrated to shipboard CTD data.

It is imperative that we understand and predict the cumulative impacts that will arise from the multiple stressors associated with climate change. Unfortunately, we have few analytical tools that can be used to assess changes in the health and condition of arctic wildlife.

Our activities span the development and delivery of software tools for analysis and visualization, the provisioning of advancing visualization and collaboration environments, web engineering for all of UCAR, R&D endeavors in collaboratories, the development of a new generation of data management and access, Grid R&D, novel visualization capabilities, and a sizable outreach effort.\n\nVETS grew to 22 staff members in FY2003, which includes several student contributors and new positions coming from external funds. We were awarded continued NCAR funding for a Cyberinfrastructure Strategic Initiative, and this covers two additional staff positions. We were successful in our bid to the NSF ITR Program and received an award to join with U.C. Davis in developing new visualization technology. We also received a three-year grant from NASA to develop a Grid environment for biogeochemical modeling and analysis, an effort that will have substantial synergy with our Community Data Portal (CDP) and Earth System Grid (ESG) projects. We complete another year as a strong contributor to the Unidata-led THREDDS effort. VETS contributed as an unfunded partner to the NSF Alliance Expedition, Scientific Workspaces of the Future, which is moving forward the tool agenda in the context of the Access Grid. We submitted a proposal to join NSF's Extensible Terascale Facility (ETF) and were competitive, but did not receive an award.\n\nOur NCAR Command Language (NCL) software continues to grow in popularity in atmospheric science research, but it is also being adopted by other agencies, the military, the Earth Simulator Center in Japan, and even in classrooms. We added some important new capabilities this year, in particular the ability to effectively visualize data with curvilinear coordinate systems, which is important for CCSM and other research efforts. This year we launched an aggressive effort to refactor our core software structure in support of developing a new language layer, Python, on top of NCL's formidable capabilities. This is an important first step toward a larger, next-generation framework. We also deployed SGI's Visual Area Networking as a pilot project aimed at evaluating one approach to delivering powerful 3D visualization onto a wide variety of user desktops.\n\nSummary provided by: http://www.cisl.ucar.edu/docs/asr2003/vets.html",

            "definition": "The climate response to variability in volcanic aerosols and solar irradiance, the primary forcings during the preindustrial era, is examined in a stratosphere-resolving general circulation model. The best agreement with historical and proxy data is obtained using both forcings, each of which has a significant effect on global mean temperatures. However, their regional climate impacts in the Northern Hemisphere are quite different. While the short-term continental winter warming response to volcanism is well known, it is shown that due to opposing dynamical and radiative effects, the long-term (decadal mean) regional response is not significant compared to unforced variability for either the winter or the annual average. In contrast, the long-term regional response to solar forcing greatly exceeds unforced variability for both time averages, as the dynamical and radiative effects reinforce one another, and produces climate anomalies similar to those seen during the Little Ice Age. Thus, long-term regional changes during the preindustrial appear to have been dominated by solar forcing.\n\nhttp://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0442(2003)016%3C4094%3AVASFOC%3E2.0.CO%3B2",

The recently launched (Dec. 1999) Terra satellite is the\nfirst of two (the second, called Aqua, is scheduled for launch in\nDec. 2000) EOS satellites designed to measure earth surface and\natmospheric characteristics over the global domain. Expected science\nproducts include global cloud cover and cloud type, atmospheric\ntemperature and moisture, surface reflectance, and sea surface\ntemperature among many others. These measurements will lead to further\nunderstanding of the earth's radiation budget and global climate\nchange. WISC-T2000 focuses on two of the five Terra instruments, the\nMODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the\nMultiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). During the experiment a\nNASA ER-2 aircraft will be based in Madison, WI and will carry\ncarefully calibrated instrumentation designed to simulate MODIS and\nMISR measurements from Terra. The ER-2 will be used to map surface and\natmospheric properties while Terra is overhead. The ER-2\ninstrumentation includes the MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS), the\nScanning High-resolution Interferometer Sounder (S-HIS), the Cloud\nLidar System (CLS), the Air Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer\n(AirMISR), and two camera systems. The MAS data will provide 50 m\nresolution images of the earth in solar and thermal bands for mapping\nhigh resolution spatial variation. The S-HIS will be used to measure\nthe vertical atmospheric profile, producing soundings much like\nweather balloons. CLS will be used to map the vertical profile of\nclouds and aerosols beneath the ER-2. AirMISR will make multi-angle\nmeasurements of earth reflectance to assess the angular distribution\nof solar reflection.\n\nThere are several primary objectives of WISC-T2000:\n\n1.To validate cloud detection, cloud height, and cloud particle\ncharacteristics measured by MODIS on Terra, the ER-2 will fly under\nMODIS while single layer ice and water clouds are in the scene. These\nflights will take place over the DOE ARM CART site in Oklahoma where\nmany ground-based instruments will also be making cloud measurements.\n\n2.To validate snow detection by MODIS, the ER-2 will fly over snow\nfields in the Upper Midwest with measurement teams on the ground. MAS\ndata will be used to map the spatial variability of the snow fields\nfor comparison to MODIS.\n\n3.To validate the multi-angle reflectance characteristics of snow\nfields, the AirMISR instrument will measure snow surfaces on frozen\nUpper Midwest lakes at the same viewing angles as those of MISR.\n\n4.To validate clear atmospheric temperature and moisture structure,\nMAS and S-HIS measurements over the DOE ARM CART site will be compared\nto those from MODIS.\n\n5.To validate the radiometric calibration of MODIS, MAS and S-HIS\nradiance measurements will be compared directly to those of\nMODIS. This important fuResults of the above objectives will be used\nto adjust and refine the MODIS and MISR global products leading to a\nmore accurate assessment of the earth's current climate status and\nchanges that occur over the 10 year combined lifetime of the Terra and\nensuing Aqua missions.\n\n\nWISC-T2000, the first in a series of Terra science product validation\nexperiments, is a combined effort of NASA's Dryden Flight Research\nCenter (DFRC), the University of Wisconsin's Space Science and\nEngineering Center (SSEC), NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the\nUniversity of Colorado and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center\n(GSFC).

The experiment is being conducted by the Naval Command, Control and Ocean Surveillance Center RDT&E Division jointly with the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA, the Naval Research Laboratory (Washington, DC and Monterey), and the Naval Postgraduate School. In addition, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Environmental Technology Laboratory, Penn State University Applied Research Laboratory and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory participated in the intensive measurement phase of VOCAR. The objectives of VOCAR are to provide an assessment capability for horizontally varying refractivity conditions in a coastal environment and to develop a remote sensing capability. The propagation measurements being made during VOCAR consist of monitoring signal strength variations of VHF/UHF transmitters in the southern California coastal region. Corresponding meteorological measurements are made during routine, special, and intensive observation periods.\n\nInformation provided by http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA289202",

The planned program will use improved drilling technology that enables excellent recovery of deep (>1000m) rock and sediment cores from the Antarctic margin. ANDRILL’s approach is to obtain specific reference records of key stratigraphic intervals proximal to the dynamic Antarctic cryosphere. While the ANDRILL program has already been many years in development, scientists and technical and logistical specialists from Germany, Italy, New Zealand and USA plan two major field campaigns for IPY 2007-2008: (1) Coring beneath the McMurdo Ice Shelf, where the target is a 1200 m-thick body of sediments deposited in a crustal depression that resulted from the loading of Ross Island volcanoes. The cores should yield a high-resolution record of the past few million years of ice shelf response to past interglacial warm extremes, including its role in modulation of the global oceanic conveyor, and potential vulnerability from present global warming; (2) Coring in southern McMurdo Sound where the target is middle to upper Miocene strata. The cores should allow the testing of interpretations derived from global proxy records implying a change from a warm climatic optimum ~17 Ma to the onset of major cooling ~14 Ma and the formation of a quasi-permanent ice sheet on Antarctica. During IPY 2007-2008, ANDRILL will also continue geophysical and site surveys, and planning for future drilling in McMurdo Sound and around the Antarctic continental margin. Results of these activities will provide key insights into: (A) The development and behaviour of the Antarctic cryospheric system (ice sheet, ice shelf, and sea-ice) and the magnitude and frequency of its change on centennial to millennial time scales; (B) The evolution of and timing of major tectonic episodes in Antarctic and the stratigraphic development of sedimentary basins, and; (C) The influence of Antarctic ice sheets on Cenozoic climate, the modulation of themohaline ocean circulation, and eustatic sea level change. The planned program will bring together a team of international scientists, educators and students who will work in Antarctica during the initial characterisation of cores and then in a series of workshops and meetings designed to integrate specialised investigations carried out at home laboratories following return of the cores from Antarctica.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/details.php?id=186",

The demand for vulnerability maps among development agencies and governments is increasing as greater emphasis is placed on scientifically sound methods for targeting adaptation assistance. Such mapping is useful because climate variability and extremes, the sensitivity of populations and systems to climatic stresses, and adaptive/coping capacities are all spatially differentiated. The interplay of these factors produces different patterns of vulnerability.\n\nThe data sets in this collection were used in a study to assess the vulnerability of West Africa's coastline to climate stresses. The study sought to illuminate the economic, social, and natural systems in West Africa that will be exposed to future sea-level rise, storm surge, and riparian floods. The study covered the Guinea Current countries, extending from Guinea-Bissau in the northwest to Cameroon in the southeast.  The 200 kilometer coastal zone covered in the study is larger than what might normally be construed as “coastal” in recognition of the fact that the economic impacts of climate change will not be confined to the coastline itself, but will extend further inland. This is especially the case if one considers not only direct impacts but also secondary impacts on livelihoods and economies tied to coastal cities. Almost half of the region’s population—24 million people—live within 200 kilometers of the coast.\n\nThe study integrated remote sensing derived data -- Altimeter Corrected Elevations 2 (ACE2) data set (which adjusts NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data in forested coastal areas using altimeter data), night-time lights defined urban extents, and Landsat-derived deforestation data -- with a variety of population, poverty, and other socioeconomic data. The study also created two composite indices (one representing social vulnerability and another representing economic systems), projected the population of the region to 2050, and examined the natural systems that will be exposed.",

            "definition": "In all colonial pinnipeds studied, mother-young vocal recognition exists and allows rapid and reliable meetings in spite of the confusing environment of the breeding colony. The efficiency of this recognition process guarantees pup survival, especially in species where females alternate foraging sea trips and lactation periods on land. The Atlantic Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) is a highly gregarious pinniped with females attending their calves for an extended period of time (2-3 years). Although we expect mother-calf vocal recognition to occur in this species due to the high density of individuals packed in herds, it has never been experimentally demonstrated. Here, we assessed the individual stereotypy of both mother and calf barks recorded in the wild by measuring frequency and temporal acoustic parameters. Both discriminant function and artificial neural network analyses resulted in high correct classification rates, underlying a well-defined individual stereotypy in parameters related to frequency modulation and frequency values. Playback experiments showed that mothers were more responsive to the barks of their own calf than to those of unrelated young. Finally, propagation experiments revealed that barks propagate at greater distances over water surface than over ice, acoustic features such as frequency modulation and frequency spectrum being highly resistant to degradation during propagation. Thus, acoustic analysis and propagation experiments suggest that these frequency parameters might be the key acoustic features involved in the individual identification process. This experimental study clearly demonstrates that Atlantic walrus has developed a highly reliable mother-calf vocal communication allowing such strong social bond.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19960216",

We will focus mainly on the ocean circulation and climate of the NW Eurasian continental margin. The present climate in the Arctic shows signs of rapid change with decreasing sea ice cover and increasing temperature of the Atlantic Water. The implications of this warming are highly uncertain, as modelling experiments projecting temperatures for the next 100 years show a largescatter at high northern latitudes.\nThe project will include the following modules (M): M1 Rapid changes in the Atlantic Water inflow into the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean, M2 Ice sheet/glacier response to warming, M3 Improving ocean temperature and sea-ice proxies; M4 Climate modelling.\n\nM1: Periods in the past during which the climate was instable and reached warmer conditions than today: a) Marine isotope stages (MIS) 12/11; b) MIS 6/5; c) Younger Dryas/Holocene climate optimum, and d) last millennium. Sea Surface Temperature ( SST) will be quantified using a multidisciplinary approach, combining faunal/floral based transfer functions and geochemical tracers. For the Holocene and the last millennium climate will be investigated in marine sediments, lake sediments and ice cores from Svalbard and marine sediments from the SE Greenland and SW to N Iceland margin. Further, archaeological sites in Norway and Svalbard will be investigated to explore the relationship between climate and human settlement and activities.\nM2: Implications of climate warming for growth and decay of ice sheets and tide water glaciers, and its effect on ice stream dynamics in the Barents Sea and the Svalbard and SE Greenland margin.\nM3: Reconstructions of SST below 5 OC based both on transfer functions and geochemical tracers are subject to large uncertainties. This is partly due to incomplete modern training sets at high latitudes. We aim to improve modern analogue data on planktonic and benthic foraminifera, diatoms, dinocysts, foraminiferal Ca/Mg-ratios and oxygen and carbon isotopes. From the same proxies we will also develop transfer functions for sea ice.\nM4: An important motivation for attempting to simulate the climatic conditions of the past is that such experiments provide opportunities for evaluating how models respond to large changes in forcing.\nCombined with high resolution acoustic data, cores will be sampled from high resolution sediment fans off northern and western Spitsbergen, the Spitsbergen fjords (in particular Kongsfjorden) and the Barents/Kara/Laptev Sea margin. Multi-core/box core surface samples >70ON in the NE Atlantic will be sampled. The SE Greenland and SW to N Iceland component will rely on existing seafloor samples. The project will include exchange programs and training courses for PhD students and young researchers.\nThis expression of intent focus on research questions addressed by IGP-PAGES and CLIVAR.\n\nSummary provided by http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=36",

            "definition": "The Winter Cloud Experiment (WINCE) took place from January 23\nto February 13, 1997. During WINCE, an instrumented NASA ER-2\nhigh altitude research aircraft will be flown to learn more\nabout detecting clouds from space in winter conditions. WINCE\nwill provide important data with which scientists can improve\ncloud detection for future satellite instruments such as the\nMODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This NASA\nresearch instrument, scheduled for launch in mid-1998 as part of\nMission to Planet Earth, will assess earth climate trends of\nwhich clouds are such an important component.\n\nWINCE is jointly hosted by the University of Wisconsin's Space\nScience Engineering Center and the 115 Fighter Wing, Wisconsin\nAir National Guard, at Truax Field which will provide necessary\nfaciliites for supporting the NASA ER-2 research aircraft\noperations. Madison-based Persoft is providing communications\nequipment to facilitate remote data transfer to and from SSEC\ncomputers, about 5 miles away from Truax Field. Persoft\nspecializes in PC-to-host software and wireless network\nconnectivity solutions.\n\nUW scientists Steve Ackerman, William Smith and Paul Menzel will\nhead the scientific analysis of the data set, along with NASA\nscientists Dorothy Hall, Jim Spinhirne and Jim Wang of the\nGoddard Space Flight Center near Washington, DC. Their research\nfindings will be applied to cloud detection algorithms for the\nMODIS and other future satellite instruments. 'The high altitude\nnature of the ER-2 (20 km or 65000 feet) is a key element of\nWINCE. It allows our instruments to make cloud measurements much\nas they would from a satellite platform. That makes it possible\nfor us to improve our cloud detection capability before the\nsatellite is ever launched,' says Ackerman.\n\nDuring WINCE, multispectral radiometric measurements of clouds\nand the earth will be made by the MODIS Airborne Simulator\n(MAS), the High-resolution Interferometer Sounder (HIS) and the\nMicrowave Imaging Radiometer (MIR) remote sensing instruments\non the ER-2. The measurements combine observations of the\nmicrowave, infrared, and visible energy from clouds, atmosphere\nand earth into a single measurement that can be used to analyze\nthe physical mechanisms important for weather prediction and\nclimate change. Signatures of clouds over snow-covered ground\nare revealed using reflectance and temperature data derived\nfrom these measurements. 'In a visible image, both clouds and\nsnow-covered terrain are highly reflective, so they're hard to\ntell apart,' Paul Menzel explained. 'In the infrared, cold\nclouds and cold terrain emit roughly the same thermal\nenergy. Only with multispectral imaging can we hope to separate\nclouds from snow and ice-covered terrain.' Cloud height\nmeasurements f!  rom the Cloud Lidar System (CLS) onboard the\nER-2 can verify the position and thickness of clouds in the\nradiometric data. That data, when combined with the radiometric\nmeasurements, allows UW scientists to examine the underlying\nsignature of the cloud itself.\n\nScience Objectives:\n\n1. Cloud detection/properties over snow/ice background\n2. Snow detection\n3. MAS/HIS absolute calibration comparison\n4. SSEC ground-based instrumentation overflight\n5. ADEOS underflights\n\n\nFor more information, link to\n'http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/wince/wince.html'\n\n[Summary provided by WINCE]",

This project is collecting a deep ice core from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) ice flow divide and integrating approximately 40 separate but synergistic projects to analyze the ice and interpret the records.\n\nThe most significant characteristic of the WAIS Divide project is the development of climate records with an absolute, annual-layer-counted chronology for the most recent ~40,000 years. Lower temporal resolution records will extend to ~100,000 years before present. These records will enable comparison of environmental conditions between the northern and southern hemispheres, and the study of greenhouse gas concentrations in the paleo-atmosphere, with a greater level of detail than previously possible.\n\nThe WAIS Divide ice core will provide the first Southern Hemisphere climate and greenhouse gas records of comparable time resolution and duration to the Greenland ice cores enabling detailed comparison of environmental conditions between the northern and southern hemispheres, and the study of greenhouse gas concentrations in the paleo-atmosphere, with a greater level of detail than previously possible. The WAIS Divide ice core will also be used to test models of WAIS history and stability, and to investigate the biological signals contained in deep Antarctic ice cores. Unlike the Greenland ice cores, an excellent atmospheric CO2 record is expected to be obtained from the WAIS Divide ice core since Antarctic ice has an order of magnitude less dust than Greenland ice. Many other gases (both greenhouse and non-greenhouse) and their isotopes will be measured at unprecedented precision and resolution.\n\n[Project description available at: http://www.waisdivide.unh.edu/ ]",

To avoid the strong spatial variability associated to coastal\ntopography and geometry, the information which is to be provided as a\nPC Atlas will cover offshore deep water conditions. Coastal conditions\nat a site of interest could be estimated from the WERATLAS data using\na suitable coastal wave model.\n\n    Ideally, long term statistics should be based on measured\ndata. Two type of measurements are presently available:\n\n1) long time series at fixed positions, mostly obtained with buoys,\n\n2) extensive measurements in space, but desultory in time, obtained with\nsatellite altimeters. While their overall amount is rapidly growing with time,\nthose are still far from the quantity and spatial coverage required for a\ngeneralised statistics.\n\n  The alternative source is the output of sophisticated wave models, that\nprovide a detailed description of the wave conditions over the whole basin of\ninterest. The limit to the accuracy of their results is mostly determined by\nthe accuracy of the input wind. While the present meteorological models are\ncapable of remarkable accuracy in the description of the surface wind fields,\nparticularly in the open oceans, their quality deteriorates when we move back\nin time - key are 1987 and 1991, when, following the evolution of computer\npower, substantial model improvements took place.\n\n   The two main European sources of information about wind and waves are the\nEuropean Centre for Medium-Range  Weather Forecast (ECMWF, Reading, UK) and\nthe UK Meteorological products from the two centres revealed that ECMWF data\nwas the more accurate data set. We have therefore based our analysis on this\nsource.\n\n   ECMWF runs daily two wave models, one globally and one for the\nMediterranean Sea, since July 1992. To extend the analysis period, the wave\nmodel (the third generation WAM model) was run for the Atlantic ocean since\n1987 using the locally archived wind fields. This has not been possible for the\nMediterranean Sea, because of the low quality of the wind fields in this area\nbefore the latest improvement.\n\n   The wave model data are being validated, and possibly calibrated, using\navailable buoy and satellite data. Note that the calibration is possible only\nunder certain conditions (spatial uniformity being the stringent one) and after\na careful screening of the data with respect to the height, period and\ndirection.\n\n    Where the wave model results are less reliable, we use only the\navailable measured data. This is the case for the Norwegian Sea (near the\nnorthern limit of the model) and the North Sea (due to the coarse resolution\nused in the Atlantic wave model).\n\n    We summarise below the main characteristics and the locations of the\navailable data.\n\n    ATLANTIC OCEAN\n    1.

Researchers will use the data to\nimprove algorithms for the detection, analysis and prediction of\nmesoscale weather phenomena and activity which affects the\naviation industry: ceiling and visibility, precipitation type\nand amount, thunderstorms, microbursts, and icing. Two other\nareas where water vapor has a secondary role are in convective\nturbulence (where water vapor gradients affect atmospheric\nstability) and in flight-level winds where the synoptic scale\nwind patterns are often significantly disrupted by mesoscale\noutflow (where water vapor plays a role in mesoscale development\nand decay).\n\nProgram:\n\nResults of the first phase of evaluation of the WVSS-I, which\nuses a thin-film capacitor to measure relative humidity, are\navailable from this web site under the document entitled 'Water\nVapor Profiles from Commercial Aircraft'.  THese results include\nevaluation of measurements from the six UPS B-757 aircraft that\nhad the Allied Signal avionics and the WVSS-I software.  Results\nfrom six months of data (July 1, 1999 to December 31, 1999) from\nthese WVSS-I equipped aircraft reveal that the commercial\naircraft profiles are competitive with radiosondes on\nascent/descent and superior to radiosondes in the upper\ntroposphere.\n\nComparisons of opportunity with radiosondes (when equipped\naircraft made ascent/descents near a radiosonde site) also\nrevealed the capability of depicting the moist absolutely\nunstable layers (MAULs) describe by Bryan and Fritsch (2000).\nSee the document above for the detailed reference.  A number of\nexamples of MAULs including those seen in radiosondes are shown\nin this document.  Statistics on the occurrence of MAULs (in the\ncommercial aircraft data and in radiosondes) are also provided.\n\nData from the second phase of the WVSS-I evaluation (after the\nnew Teledyne avionics equipment had replaced the Allied Signal\navionics is available to users as describe below.  One of the\nlimitations of the WVSS-I technology ( the Vaisala thin-film\ncapacitor technology which was an improved version over that\nsame sensor used in Vaisala radiosondes) is the 'aging' of the\nsensor over time.  This aging eventually results in a dry-bias\nover time -- requiring that the sensor be replaced and then\nrecalibrated.\n\nNote that such aging takes place while the unit sits on a shelf\n(although presumably at a slower pace than when it is in\noperation on the aircraft). THere is considerable variability in\nthis aging process -- this being one of the major reasons for\nabandoning this sensor for the WVSS-II sensor described below.\n\nAs the WVSS-I Program is experimental (not operational) with a\nlimited budget, these sensors were not immediately replaced when\nthey should have been -- instead, part of the evaluation process\nwas to see how long the sensors would last.  Thus, Table 1 below\nshows those time periods when the 30 UPS aircraft were\ninstalled, working, and did not exhibit the obvious dry-bias.\nThis table will be maintained on a monthly basis through\ncalendar year 2002.

Broadly\nstated, this experiment is designed to address current research\nquestions relating to tornadogenesis and tornado dynamics. It\nwill be hosted by the National Severe Storms Laboratory, and\nwill involve the collaboration of the University of Oklahoma and\nthe Center for the Analysis and Prediction of Storms (CAPS),\nTexas A&M University, the University of Illinois, Texas Tech\nUniversity, New Mexico Tech, the University of West Virginia,\nthe University of Alabama at Huntsville, the University of\nCalifornia at Los Angeles (UCLA), the National Center for\nAtmospheric Research (NCAR), the National Science Foundation\n(NSF), NOAA/NWS (National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration/National Weather Service), and Atmosphere\nEnvironment Service (AES; Canada).\n\nThe primary benefit of VORTEX will be the new knowledge\ngenerated through careful analysis of the data sets obtained\nduring the field experiments. This new knowledge should lead to\nsome very practical benefits.\n\nThis experiment is being executed with a set of specific\nscientific hypotheses in mind, as documented elsewhere ( '\nScientific Objectives' ), but the general sense of the\nexperiment is to increase understanding of tornadogenesis,\nthereby enhancing the ability to anticipate tornado\ndevelopment. Many of the scientific objectives are closely tied\nto the mission statement of SELS (soon to become SPC). With the\ndeployment of Doppler radars around the nation, it is becoming\nincreasingly obvious that (1) even this exciting new tool has\nsome limits in its tornado detection capability, as do all\nweather radars, and (2) not all mesocyclonic circulations\ndetectable by a Doppler radar will become tornadic. Since not\nall detectable mesocyclones go on to produce tornadoes, it is\nquite crucial to tornado warning operations at the WFO level\n(in the reorganized NWS) that we have some means to distinguish\ntornadic from non-tornadic circulations (as seen on a\nWSR-88D). Otherwise, excessive fal!  se alarms could damage NWS\ncredibility. Tornadoes produced from non-mesocyclonic storms,\nabout which we hope to learn in VORTEX, are another challenge\nwith direct application to operations.\n\nIn the warning process, it is not only important to know if a\ntornado is about to form, but also to be able to predict when\nthe tornado will dissipate. VORTEX is designed to acquire new\ninformation that may allow users of WSR-88D data to interpret\nradar signatures to diagnose tornado dissipation, and to predict\nthe formation of additional tornadoes in cyclic storms.\n\nIn the process, an important issue becomes the interaction\nbetween the potentially tornadic storm and its\nenvironment. Modelling work (numerical and mathematical) and\nsome limited observational studies have suggested some ways to\ndistinguish tornado-prone environments from those that are not,\nbut these concepts have yet to be given an adequate test. Given\nthat the detection of a potentially tornadic storm is more\nlikely when the forecasters have anticipated such a possibility\nthan when they have not, the VORTEX operating plan also includes\nsome experimental forecasting techniques that may become\nprototypes for how operational tornado forecasting will be done\nin the future. Preventing false alarms is just as important as\nnot missing important events. Many of the hypotheses being\ninvestigated in VORTEX are designed to resolve these important\nissues and explore new methods for dealing with the tornado\nproblem.\n\nEspecially exciting will be the incorporation of some\nexperimental numerical modelling on the mesoscale and the storm\nscale, with the participation of CAPS (Center for the Analysis\nand Prediction of Storms, affiliated with the University of\nOklahoma). Operational implementation of such numerical models\nis in its infancy, but it appears quite likely that mesoscale\nand storm scale models will eventually have some role in\noperations. By participating in VORTEX, a number of NWS\nforecasters from the NOC and the SPC will have a chance to\nexperiment with using such forecasting input. This gives those\nindividuals an opportunity to have input on how such models\nwill be implemented in the future, based on their\nexperiences. A continuing problem with introduction of new\ntechnology is that forecasters often have so little experience\nwith the new systems that they have no chance to influence the\nacquisition and evolution of the new technological tools until\nvery late in the game. By bein!  g involved with VORTEX, the\nparticipating forecasters (and their associated agencies) have\na real chance to affect the implementation of new forecasting\ntechniques and technology.\n\nSimilar benefits accrue for the participating forecasters (and,\ntheir associated agencies within the NWS) as a result of\ninteracting with the principal scientific investigators. This is\nespecially important for the OUN NOC by virtue of their combined\nresearch-operations mission. By their involvement, contact by\nthe NWS with the leading scientists in the area gives the NWS an\nopportunity to (a) learn about what the research community is\ndoing in this topic area, and (b) offer their insights about\nwhat problems the NWS is encountering. This experiment is an\nideal venue for encouraging research-operations interaction that\ncan only benefit all of the agencies involved.\n\nFinally, the new knowledge we hope to gain through VORTEX\ntornado dynamics studies should enable structural engineers to\nestablish improved design standards to mitigate tornado damage.\n\nFor more information, link to\n'http://mrd3.nssl.ucar.edu/~vortex/OpsPlan/WWW_TOC.good.html'",
