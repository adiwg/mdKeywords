CIOSS provides a mechanism to bring together the resources of a research-oriented university (OSU), NESDIS and other NOAA line offices, with additional partners at other universities, government and private agencies. With these partners, CIOSS conducts research of mutual interest to CIOSS/COAS and NOAA. This research helps NOAA to accomplish its Mission Goals and helps NESDIS to fulfill its role in providing the remote sensing component of the 'national backbone' for the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), which includes operational and research components within NOAA, ONR, NSF and NASA. CIOSS contributes to the development of ocean observing and modeling systems, along with public understanding of those systems, through:\n\n- Research that helps to develop and improve our understanding of, and operational products related to, the upper ocean and air-sea interface. It does this by using data from present and past satellites and by helping to plan future satellite sensors;\n\n- Research that helps to incorporate and assimilate those products and understanding into ocean and atmosphere circulation models; and\n\n- Education and training in the same topics, reaching a wide range of 'audiences' in formal education (K-16 education, graduate school, ongoing professional training) and informal education (public outreach).\n\nCIOSS Mission, Goals and Objectives: The CIOSS mission is to enhance and improve the use of satellite remote sensing for oceanographic research, operational applications and education/outreach. To do this, CIOSS has the following broad goals and objectives:\n\n- Foster and provide a focus for research related to NOAA's mission responsibilities and strategic objectives in the coastal and open ocean, emphasizing those aspects of oceanography and air-sea interaction that utilize satellite data, along with models of oceanic and atmospheric circulation;\n\n- Collaborate with NOAA research scientists in using satellite ocean remote sensing through: evaluation, validation, and improvement of data products from existing and planned instruments; development of new multi-sensor products, models, and assimilation techniques; and investigation and creation of new approaches for satellite data production, distribution, and management;\n\n- Improve the effectiveness of graduate-level education and expand the scientific training and research experiences available to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and scientists from NOAA and other governmental laboratories and facilities; and\n\n- Educate and train research scientists, students, policy makers and the public to use, and appreciate the use of, satellite data in research that improves our understanding of the ocean and overlying atmosphere.",

PSA offers a wide range of safe, high quality scheduled and custom-made adventure trips, expeditions and services. Each one professionally designed, in close consultation with clients, carefully promoting environmental awareness, exploration and respect for nature. One of the most northerly tour operators in the world - Polar Sea's trips, expeditions and projects are planned and delivered with the intention of being environmentally, socially and economically responsible. Polar Sea is sensitive to the effects of travel on the areas we visit. We live, and are based in the Arctic, therefore have a vital and vested interest in ensuring the areas we journey to and explore are respected and protected. Group sizes are kept small to avoid impacting the things that attract people to visit in the first place. We are actively dedicated to the protection of the Arctic and strive to play a role in encouraging and promoting the responsible and ethical development of this incredible, unique and important part of our planet.\n\nThe Arctic Base Camp (ABC) project involves PSA and a number of other related companies, individuals and organizations. The ABC will be the creation of a science based research facility that in addition will cater for a number of equally important activities and projects. In collaboration with outdoor equipment manufacturer Mountain Hard Wear, the ABC will consist of three Space Stations (kitchen, dining room and recreation room) twelve Satellite tents (for guests and staff accommodation) and two Stronghold (for workshops and laboratories) The Nunavut Territorial Government, Nunavut Tourism, the local hamlet council and local businesses have already expresses interest in the project\n\nUses for the ABC include: \nScience/research laboratory, training facility for young scientists and researchers, Inuit Elders & Youth retreat, camp for schools, colleges and universities, training facility for young Inuit interested in a career in the sustainable tourism industry and as a defined destination for people from around the world interested in the Arctic environment.\n\nThe science and research part of the ABC would be set up similar to an Earthwatch program (earthwatch.org) Paying clients would be invited to join scientists and researchers in the field to help and assist with the work being done. The ABC season will start in early April and run until late September. Being located on the sea ice during the spring months, the camp will represent and illustrate low-impact and sustainable use of the Arctic environment. In late June the 'land' on which it is located will cease to exist, therefore no trace of the camp ever being there will exist. The ABC will be seasonal yet prove to have year round benefits to all those involved.\n\nThe ABC will be created to be an on-going research and training facility. We believe that the long term benefits of the camp will be significant. Good science will be conducted and a sustainable project for the Inuit of the North Baffin region (and beyond) will be started and built upon.",

HyspIRI will be able to identify the type of vegetation that is present and whether the vegetation is healthy. The mission will provide a benchmark on the state of the worlds ecosystems against which future changes can be assessed. The mission will also assess the pre-eruptive behavior of volcanoes and the likelihood of future eruptions as well as the carbon and other gases released from wildfires.\n\nThe HyspIRI mission includes two instruments mounted on a satellite in Low Earth Orbit. There is an imaging spectrometer measuring from the visible to short wave infrared (VSWIR: 380 nm - 2500 nm) in 10 nm contiguous bands and a multispectral imager measuring from 3 to 12 um in the mid and thermal infrared (TIR). The VSWIR and TIR instruments both have a spatial resolution of 60 m at nadir. The VSWIR will have a revisit of of 19 days and the TIR will have a revisit of 5 days. HyspIRI also includes an Intelligent Payload Module (IPM) which will enable direct broadcast of a subset of the data.\n\nNASA will conduct airborne campaigns for the HyspIRI mission.  For these campaigns, NASA will fly the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and the MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) instruments on a NASA ER-2 aircraft  to collect precursor datasets in advance of the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission. The primary goal of this activity is to demonstrate important science and applications research that is uniquely enabled by HyspIRI like data, taking advantage of the contiguous spectroscopic measurements of the AVIRIS, the full suite of MASTER TIR bands, or combinations of measurements from both instruments.",

With these instruments, stratospheric H2O measurements can be accomplished with a precision of < 0.2 ppmv at 1 s integration time, as has been demonstrated both in the laboratory and under field deployment. The design enables a rapid exchange of the air sample of the order of 1 s for fast measurements of small-scale variations of the H2O mixing ratio in the atmosphere. The hygrometer is calibrated using a laboratory calibration bench with approximately 4% accuracy. Measurements made by the hygrometer are compared with a frost point hygrometer during an aircraft mission at H2O mixing ratios from 280 to 8 ppmv, yielding an agreement between both techniques within the instrumental errors.",

The research aircraft arrived at NASA Langley on December 7, 2017.  NASA Langley has installed an engine hush kit and  two nadir portals in the fuselage. The hush kit enables the aircraft to be Stage III noise compliant, allowing the aircraft to deploy nationwide and worldwide without requiring engine noise waivers. The nadir portals allow the aircraft to install earth science sensors, as is currently possible with the Center’s two King Air aircraft and the HU-25A aircraft.

            "definition": "When the world's first jet airliner, the De Havilland Comet, was introduced in 1949, Douglas held a commanding position in the aircraft market. Although Boeing had pointed the way to the modern all-metal airliner in 1933 with the 247, it was Douglas that, more than any other company, made the promise a reality. Douglas produced a succession of piston-engined commercial aircraft through the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s: 138 DC-2s, 10,928 DC-3s (mostly for military service in World War II), 1453 DC-4s, 537 DC-6s and 226 DC-7s.\n\nGiven the success of their designs, Douglas took the view that there was no reason to rush into anything new, as did their rivals Lockheed and Convair. Most air transport manufacturers expected that there would be a gradual switch, from piston engines to turbines and that it would be to the more fuel-efficient turboprop engines rather than pure jets.\n\nIn contrast, Boeing took the bold step of starting to plan a pure jet airliner as early as 1949. Boeing's military arm had gained extensive experience with large, long-range jets through the B-47 Stratojet (first flight 1947) and the B-52 Stratofortress (1952). With thousands of their big jet bombers on order or in service, Boeing had developed a close relationship with the U.S. Air Force Strategic Air Command (SAC), and could count on having preference when the time came to replace SAC's fleet of piston-engined KC-97 Stratotankers. For Boeing, this was an opportunity to build a jet aircraft for air-to-air refueling that could be turned into a commercial transport.\n\n[Text provided by: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-8 ]\n\n[Photo provided by: http://www.aerospaceweb.org/ ]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: DC-8\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Aircraft\n      Short_Name: DC-8\n      Long_Name: Douglas DC-8\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAPS\n      Short_Name: PRESSURE TRANSDUCERS\n      Short_Name: TEMPERATURE PROBES\n      Short_Name: PITOT-STATIC SYSTEM\n      Short_Name: INS\n      Short_Name: ROSEMOUNT PROBES\n      Short_Name: CDP\n      Short_Name: PIP\n      Short_Name: DC8 DROPSONDES\n      Short_Name: DROPSONDES\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-14\n   Online_Resource: http://www1.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-050-DFRC.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/jetliner/dc8/dc8_06.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Observations of surface deformation are used to forecast the likelihood of earthquakes occurring as a function of location, as well as predicting both the place and time that volcanic eruptions and landslides are likely. Advances in earthquake science leading to improved time-dependent probabilities would be significantly facilitated by global observations of surface deformation, and could result in significant increases in the health and safety of the public due to decreased exposure to tectonic hazards. Monitoring surface deformation is also important for improving the safety and efficiency of extraction of hydrocarbons, for managing our ground water resources, and, in the future, providing information for managing CO2 sequestration.\n\nMission Objectives\n\n- Determine the likelihood of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides.\n- Predict the response of ice sheets to climate change and impact on the sea level.\n- Characterize the effects of changing climate and land use on species habitats and carbon budget.\n- Monitor the migration of fluids associated with hydrocarbon production and groundwater resources.\n\nThis mission combines two sensors that, taken together, provide observations important for solid-Earth (surface deformation), ecosystems (terrestrial biomass structure) and climate (ice dynamics). The sensors are: 1) an L-band Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) system with multiple polarization, and 2) a multiple beam lidar operating in the infrared (~ 1064 nm) with ~ 25 m spatial resolution and 1 m vertical accuracy. The mission using InSAR to meet the science measurement objectives for surface deformation, ice sheet dynamics, and ecosystem structure has been extensively studied. It requires a satellite in 700-800 km sun-synchronous orbit in order to maximize available power from the solar arrays. An eight day revisit frequency balances temporal de-correlation with required coverage. Onboard GPS achieves cm-level orbit and baseline knowledge to improve calibration. The mission should have a 5 year life time to capture time-variable processes and achieve measurement accuracy.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: DESDYNI\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: DESDYNI\n      Long_Name: Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2009-02-25\n   Online_Resource: https://science.nasa.gov/\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Through hard work for more than ten years, the\nfirst FY-2 satellite was launched on June 10, 1997 and located\nin the geostationary orbit at an altitude of 35800 kilometers\nover 105 degrees E. The satellite is a cylinder of 2.1 m by\n1.6 m. The attitude of the satellite is spin stabilized with a\nspeed of 100 rotation/min.\n\nFY-2A is the first geostationary meteorological satellite in\nChina. It is a spin-stabilized satellite. The main function of\nFY-2A is observation. It takes visible, infrared and water vapor\ndisk images of the Earth hourly. The main payload of FY-2A is a\nVisible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR).\n\nThe VISSR takes the Earth and cloud images from the space. A\ncomplete 20° x20° scan covering the full Earth disk can be\naccomplished every 30 minutes by means of combination of\nsatellite spin motion (100 rpm from the west to east) and step\naction of the scan mirror (2500 steps from north to south). The\nS-VISSR data are retransmitted to user stations via FY-2A during\nthe VISSR observation.  The stretched VISSR (S-VISSR) data are\nthe digital image data originated by VISSR on board and\nstretched on the Command and Data Acquisition Station (CDAS) in\ntime. After stretching, the transmission rate of S-VISSR data is\nreduced and can be easily received by the users. \n\nAdditional information available at\nhttp://nsmc.cma.gov.cn/fy2e.html\n\n[Summary provided by China's National Satellite Meteorological Center]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: FY-2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: FY (Feng-Yun)\n      Short_Name: FY-2\n      Long_Name: China's  Meteorological Satellite-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Feng Yun 2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: VISSR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 35,800 km\n      Orbit_Type: GEO > Geosynchronous > Geostationary\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-09-26\n   Online_Resource: http://www.fas.org/spp/guide/china/earth/fy-2.htm\n   Sample_Image: http://www.fas.org/spp/guide/china/earth/fy2-s.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1997-06-10\n      Launch_Site: Xichang Space Launch Center, China\n      Primary_Sponsor: CHINA/CMA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

They are linked to the ship by a group of cables that carry electrical signals back and forth between the operator and the vehicle. Most are equipped with at least a video camera and lights. Additional equipment is commonly added to expand the vehicle's capabilities. These may include a still camera, a manipulator or cutting arm, water samplers, and instruments that measure water clarity, light penetration, and temperature. First developed for industrial purposes, such as internal and external inspections of pipelines and the structural testing of offshore platforms, ROVs are now used for many applications, many of them scientific. They have proven extremely valuable in ocean exploration, and are also used for educational programs at aquaria and to link to scientific expeditions live via the internet.\n\n[Information obtained from http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/technology/subs/rov/rov.html ]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: ROV\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: In Situ Ocean-based Platforms\n      Short_Name: ROV\n      Long_Name: Remotely Operated Vehicles\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: ROV\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-12-13\n   Online_Resource: http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/technology/subs/rov/rov.html\n   Sample_Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/ROV_working_on_a_subsea_structure.jpg/400px-ROV_working_on_a_subsea_structure.jpg\nEnd_Group",

The series, originally planned to acquire data throughout the Sun's 11-year active cycle, investigated how Earth's atmosphere and climate are affected by the Sun, and by the products of industrial complexes and agricultural activities.  ATLAS 1, the first spacecraft in this series conducted 14 investigations in atmospheric science, solar physics, space plasma physics, and astrophysics.\n\nThe 14 ATLAS 1 experiments included:\n(1) Atmospheric Lyman-Alpha Emissions (ALAE)\n(2) Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS)\n(3) Grille Spectrometer (GRILLE)\n(4) Imaging Spectrometric Observatory (ISO)\n(5) Millimeter-wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS)\n(6) Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Spectrometer (SSBUV-4) -\ntechnically, this instrument was seperate from the ATLAS payload and\nwas a co-manifested payload\n(7) Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM)\n(8) Solar Spectrum Measurement (SOLSPEC)\n(9) Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM)\n(10) Measurement of the Solar Constant (SOLCON)\n(11) Atmospheric Emissions Photometric Imaging (AEPI)\n(12) Space Experiments with Particle Accelerators (SEPAC)\n(13) Energetic Neutral Atom Precipitation (ENAP). ENAP was not a\nseperate instrument but used the ISO instrument measurements\n(14) Far Ultraviolet Space Telescope (FAUST)\n\nATLAS 2 was flown on the STS-56 in April 1993 and consisted of seven of the ATLAS 1 instruments: ATMOS, MAS, SSBUV-5, ACRIM, SOLSPEC, SUSIM, AND SOLCON.\n\nATLAS 3 was flown on the STS-66 in November 1993 and consisted of the same instruments as ATLAS 2.\n\nThese investigations studied the chemical makeup of the atmosphere between approximately 15 and 600 kilometers (8.3 to 330 miles) above the Earth's surface, measured the total energy contained in sunlight and energy variations, investigated how Earth's electric and magnetic fields and atmosphere influence each other, and examined sources of ultraviolet light in the Universe.  The instruments were mounted on two Spacelab pallets in the Shuttle payload bay.  The Shuttle's changing orientation to Earth placed the experiments in advantageous orbiting locations, to observe the atmosphere, the Sun, and astronomical targets.  Specifically, the orbiter orientation was either inertially fixed so that selected instruments were pointed at the sun, or nadir pointed for observations of the Earth's atmosphere. Crew members were in consultation with the investigators while controlling and monitoring the experiments. The atmospheric and solar instruments provided correlative measurements with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: ATLAS\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SPACE SHUTTLE\n      Short_Name: ATLAS\n      Long_Name: Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: ATLAS\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-24\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/factsheet/Atlas-1_factsheet_prt.htm\n   Sample_Image: http://www.ghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/images/atlas/atlaslogo.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

However LGGE has other very competitive know-how focused on snow and ice, as the physical and mechanical properties of ice, the air-snow chemical exchange or the acquisition of field data and satellite . The research carried out combines technological and analytical approach to numerical modeling related to various fields, from the atmosphere to the flow of ice masses. The Arctic and Antarctic polar regions are preferred sites of action of LGGE but experience also extends to mountain areas: study of alpine glaciers, Andean and Himalayan pollution in the Alpine valleys. These studies contribute to understanding major scientific problems that are often social issues such as the greenhouse effect, climate variability and the environment, the mass balance of the cryosphere, the wide pollution global and regional or glacial hazards. The research topics of LGGE developed within the four scientific teams are presented in the 'Research Teams' and the list of publications and activity reports are available in 'Scientific Production'.",

The research carried out combines technological and analytical approach to numerical modeling related to various fields, from the atmosphere to the flow of ice masses. The Arctic and Antarctic polar regions are preferred sites of action of LGGE but experience also extends to mountain areas: study of alpine glaciers, Andean and Himalayan pollution in the Alpine valleys. These studies contribute to understanding major scientific problems that are often social issues such as the greenhouse effect, climate variability and the environment, the mass balance of the cryosphere, the wide pollution global and regional or glacial hazards.\nThe research topics of LGGE developed within the four scientific teams are presented in the 'Research Teams' and the list of publications and activity reports are available in 'Scientific Production'",

Its science objectives are: to improve ongoing efforts to predict climate by providing near-global measurement of precipitation, its distribution, and physical processes; to improve the accuracy of weather and precipitation forecasts through more accurate measurement of rain rates and latent heating; and to provide more frequent and complete sampling of the Earth's precipitation. GPM Constellation is envisioned to consist of a core spacecraft to measure precipitation structure and to provide a calibration standard for the constellation spacecraft, an international constellation of NASA and contributed spacecraft to provide frequent precipitation measurements on a global basis, calibration/validation sites distributed globally with a broad array of precipitation-measuring instrumentation, and a global precipitation data system to produce and distribute global rain maps and climate research products.",

During these time periods a number of unusual seed\nplant groups evolved, several of which have been implicated as possible\nancestors of the flowering plants (angiosperms), the group that dominates the\nworld today.The availability of anatomically preserved material from these\ngroups has furthered our knowledge of seed plant evolution in the late\nPaleozoic and Mesozoic considerably.\n\nThis research has already produced significant results including:\n\n-The oldest, anatomically preserved fossil cycad (Smoot et al., 1985) and\nassociated pollen cone (Klavins et al., 2003)\n\n-Evidence of polyembryony in Permian seeds (Smoot and Taylor, 1986)\n\n-Two standing fossil forests which grew at very high paleolatitudes\n(80-85º S in the Permian; 70-75º in the Triassic) (Taylor et al., 1992; Cúneo\net al., 2003)\n\n-Anatomically preserved reproductive organs of the Permian seed ferns,\nGlossopteridales (Taylor and Taylor, 1992) and associated stems and leaves\n(Pigg et al., 1990, 1993)\n\n-The discovery that Triassic Dicroidium-type leaves were borne on\ndifferent stem types in East Gondwana and West Gondwana (Meyer-Berthaud et al.,\n1993)\n\n-A completely new group of Mesozoic seed ferns, the Petriellales, which\nshow some characters similar to the flowering plants (Triassic) (Taylor et al.,\n1994)\n\n-Triassic specimens of Osmunda, the 'interrupted fern,' which appear\nalmost identical to modern forms (Phipps et al., 1998)\n\n-Data on paleoclimate in Antarctica based on fossil tree rings, indicating\nthat the poles were warmer than has been suggested from physical paleoclimate\nmodels (Taylor et al., 2000)\n\n-The first evidence of the attachment of Dicroidium fronds, the most\ncommon leaf type in the Triassic of the southern hemisphere, to stems that also\nbear seeds in cupules (Axsmith et al., 2000)\n\nWebsite: http://paleobotany.bio.ku.edu/default.htm\n\n[Summary provided by the University of Kansas.]",

Together, these programs form a national network of over 300 participating institutions involving more than 3,000 scientists, engineers, educators, students, and outreach experts.\n\nSea Grant’s legislative charge is to “increase the understanding, assessment, development, utilization, and conservation of the nation’s ocean and coastal resources by providing assistance to promote a strong educational base, responsive research and training activities, and broad and prompt dissemination of knowledge and techniques.”\n\nLocally, Sea Grant’s affiliation with WHOI began in 1971 with support for a number of individual research projects. In 1973, WHOI was designated a Coherent Sea Grant Program and, in 1985, was elevated to its current status as an Institutional Sea Grant Program. The Woods Hole Sea Grant Program has made great strides to channel the expertise of world-renowned ocean scientists toward meeting the research and information needs of users of the marine environment. Public and private institutions throughout Massachusetts, and the northeast region, participate in the Woods Hole Sea Grant Program.\n\nSummary provided by http://www.whoi.edu/seagrant/",

The GLORIA system is a digital side\nscan sonar system capable of producing digital image maps of the seafloor from\nreflected sound waves. \n\nThe GLORIA creates sonographs by transmitting images by way of sound pulses and\nrecorded echoes from the sea floor as the collecting ship moves along a set\ncourse.  The sound source and receivers are built into a 'fish' that is towed\nabout 200 meters behind a ship. This electronic mapping system brings out a\nsignal pulse every 30 seconds, which is then recorded by shipboard computers.\nThe GLORIA provides such a broad view of the seafloor.  The recorded digital\ndata are processed and used to construct digital maps of the seafloor.\n\nWebsite: http://coastalmap.marine.usgs.gov/gloria/\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
