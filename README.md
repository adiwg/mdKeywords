# mdkeywords

## harvesters/

This directory contains the configurations and source files for the harvesters to generate keyword files.

## resources/

This directory contains the json file for the list of vocabularies (vocabularies.json). It is automatically generated and contains the citation information for a vocabulary.

### resources/json/

This directory contains all the keywords files in the mdEditor's json format.

## Getting Started

Generally speaking, this repository is expected to run inside a GitHub actions workflow, however, for development purposes, you can run this locally.

### Install and Run

Your working directory needs to be harvesters/ then run 'npm install' and 'npm start'

The harvesters are driven from the profiles in the mdProfiles repository. The main process starts by compiling a list of unique vocabularies across all the profiles,
then will process them in turn, generating a single keywords file for each vocabulary.
